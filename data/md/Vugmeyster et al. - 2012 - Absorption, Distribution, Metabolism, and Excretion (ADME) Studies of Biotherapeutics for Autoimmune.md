Abstract. Biotherapeutics are becoming an increasingly common drug class used to treat autoimmune and other in /uniFB02 ammatory conditions. Optimization of absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) pro /uniFB01 les of biotherapeutics is crucial for clinical, as well as commercial, success of these drugs. This review focuses on the common questions and challenges in ADME optimization of biotherapeutics for in /uniFB02 ammatory conditions. For these immunomodulatory and/or immunosuppressive biotherapeutics, special consideration should be given to the assessment of the interdependency of ADME pro /uniFB01 les, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationships, and immunogenicity pro /uniFB01 les across various preclinical species and humans, including the interdependencies both in biology and in assay readouts. The context of usage, such as dosing regimens, extent of disease, concomitant medications, and drug product characteristics may have a direct or indirect (via modulation of immunogenicity) impact on ADME pro /uniFB01 les of biotherapeutics. Along these lines, emerging topics include assessments of preexisting reactivity to a biotherapeutic agent, impact of immunogenicity on tissue exposure, and analysis of penetration to normal versus in /uniFB02 amed tissues. Because of the above complexities and interdependences, it is essential to interpret PK, PD, and anti-drug antibody results in an integrated manner. In addition, because of the competitive landscape in autoimmune and in /uniFB02 ammatory markets, many pioneering ADME-centric protein engineering and subsequent in vivo testing (such as optimization of novel modalities to extend serum and tissue exposures and to improve bioavailability) are being conducted with biotherapeutics in this therapeutic area. However, the ultimate challenge is demonstration of the clinical relevance (or lack thereof) of modi /uniFB01 ed ADME and immunogenicity pro /uniFB01 les.

KEY WORDS: ADME; autoimmune disease; immunogenicity; pharmacokinetics; therapeutic proteins.

## INTRODUCTION

Therapeutic proteins (also referred to as biotherapeutics) are becoming an increasingly common class of drugs to treat autoimmune and other in /uniFB02 ammatory conditions (e.g., sepsis, osteoarthritis, and chronic viral infections) in the USA, Europe, as well as in Canada and Japan. Examples of therapeutic proteins that are approved for in /uniFB02 ammatory conditions are shown in Table I. There are more than 70 different autoimmune diseases, with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), plaque psoriasis, in /uniFB02 ammatory bowel disease (IBD, includes two different diseases: ulcerative colitis [UC] and Crohn's disease [CD]), asthma, type 1 diabetes

mellitus, multiple sclerosis (MS), immune thrombocytopenia being some of the most prevalent ones. The rationale behind the use of biotherapeutics for in /uniFB02 ammatory conditions is the potential for a gentler and more targeted immunomodulation compared to conventional small-molecule compounds, such that only a subset of the in /uniFB02 ammatory or immunoregulatory pathways are targeted.

These therapeutic proteins could be grouped into several subclasses, based on the point of intervention within an in /uniFB02 ammatory cascade that is being modulated and the mode of action (Fig. 1): (1) cytokine/cytokine receptor antagonists, with multiple tumor necrosis factorÎ± (TNF) inhibitors approved for a variety of autoimmune indications and, recently, anti-B lymphocyte stimulator (BLys) Ab for SLE being the most famous examples; (2) lymphocyte-depleting agents, such as anti-CD20 and anti-CD4 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for RA; (3) agents that interfere with T cell receptor complex-mediated signal transduction and costimulatory signaling in T cell activation, including toleranceinducing agents, such as CTLA4-Ig (a fusion protein of the external domain of cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 and the Fc region of human IgG1) and anti-CD3 nonactivating mAb for RA or transplant rejection; (4) agents that interfere

Common subclasses of therapeutic proteins for treatment of autoimmune and other in /uniFB02 ammatory conditions based on points of intervention and mode of action. 1 cytokine/cytokine receptor antagonists; 2 lymphocyte-depleting agents; 3 agents that interfere with T cell -receptor ( TCR ) complex-mediated signal transduction and costimulatory signaling in T cell activation, including tolerance-inducing agents; 4 agents that interfere with cell traf /uniFB01 cking or adhesion of T cells to APCs (such as dendritic cells, macrophages, B cells) and/or endothelium (including integrin antagonists); 5 agents that target components of the innate immune system, including anti-complement ( 5a ), anti-chemokine drugs ( 5b ), or drugs targeting cellular components of the innate immune system ( 5c ). Agents in subclasses 1 , 3 , 4 , and 5c may exert their function by blocking the ligand -receptor interactions and/or by downmodulation of the expression of cell surface molecules. Some agents have multiple modes of actions and thus may be included in more than one subclass. Additional therapeutic proteins that do not directly fall in the above subclasses, as described in the text. TCR-associated complex includes TCR, CD3, CD8, or CD4 on T cells and MHC presenting an antigenic peptide on APCs. Costimulatory factors include CD28 and lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA) on T cells, CD80, CD86, and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1) on APCs.

Note that therapeutic proteins in subclasses 1, 3, 4, and 5 may exert their function by blocking the ligand -receptor interactions and/or by downmodulation of the expression of the cell surface molecules. In addition, some agents have multiple modes of action and thus may be included in more than one subclass.

Some therapeutic proteins do not directly fall in any of the above categories, for example intravenous immunoglobulin products (used to treat a number of primary immunode/uniFB01 ciencies and autoimmune diseases), anti-IgE for asthma, as well as some locally delivered agents for osteoarthritis. Chan and Carter have recently reviewed the key insights learned from the development of therapeutic antibodies for autoimmunity and in /uniFB02 ammation, the most common class of therapeutic proteins (1). This review focuses on the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) of antibodies, as well as other therapeutic proteins from the point of view of drug development in this therapeutic area.

In general, there are multiple practical and commercial constraints for delivering an effective and safe dose of a therapeutic protein, including dosing volume, dosing frequency,

cost of goods, target properties (expression pro /uniFB01 le/turnover rate), as well as a range of modalities available for a particular target. Many of the above constraints are constantly changing with the commercial landscape and advances in protein engineering, pharmaceutical, and ADME sciences. These constraints are used to guide the design of an ideal target product pro /uniFB01 le, which, in turn, evolves itself, as a therapeutic protein moves along the pipeline. When considering optimization of ADME pro /uniFB01 les, several factors -some of which are uniquely affected by in /uniFB02 ammation and autoimmune indications -should be considered. The purpose of this review is to highlight common questions and challenges encountered during the optimization of ADME and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) pro /uniFB01 les of therapeutic proteins for treating these disorders.

## INTERDEPENDENCY OF PK, PD, AND IMMUNOGENICITY PROFILES

Humanization of mouse- or rat-derived antibodies has signi /uniFB01 cantly improved the immunogenicity pro /uniFB01 les of therapeutic antibodies (1 -4). In addition, advances in protein engineering tools, such as phage display or mice expressing human immunoglobulin genes, have enabled production of fully human mAbs (reviewed in (1)). However, even fully human mAbs contain unique sequences in their CDRs, and it has become clear that nearly all therapeutic proteins, including fully human ones, may be immunogenic, depending

on the context of usage (1 -4). The context of usage includes patient/subject population (species, disease status, age, and sex), dosing regimen (dose level, route, and duration of treatment), concomitant medications, as well as the manufacturing process and formulation (affecting post-translational modi /uniFB01 cations, impurities, and aggregation).

Immunogenicity may affect both the PK and PD pro /uniFB01 les and sometimes the ef /uniFB01 cacy and safety of therapeutic proteins (Fig. 2). Speci /uniFB01 cally, anti-drug antibody (ADA) responses may introduce additional clearance and distribution pathways,

dependent on the formation of drug/ADA complexes. When a drug/ADA immune complex (IC) is formed, the clearance of a drug within the IC may be much faster compared to that for a drug not bound to ADA, leading to a rapid concentration drop in a concentration-time pro /uniFB01 le. Because the extent and rate of IC formation vary among human subjects, the IC-related clearance could be considered a major contributor to the intersubject variability in clinical and nonclinical PK pro /uniFB01 les for therapeutic proteins. The alternate scenario is also possible, especially for biotherapeutics with relatively fast clearance, in

Fig. 2. The relationship between PK, effect, and the host immune response to a therapeutic protein. Immunogenicity may affect both the PK and biological activity and ultimately the ef /uniFB01 cacy and safety of therapeutic proteins. Speci /uniFB01 cally, ADAs may introduce additional clearance and distribution pathways, dependent on formation of drug -ADA complexes. ADAs may neutralize existing biological activity and/or introduce new biological activity, in some cases causing toxicity: for example, IC deposition in the kidney, crosslinking, and subsequent signaling/agonistic activity; ADA-mediated effector functions (which may lead to depletion of target-expressing cells and hypersensitivity reactions), as well as immune reaction to or neutralization of an endogenous protein. In turn, both the PK and the biological activity of therapeutic proteins impact the host immune response to the drug. Exposure pro /uniFB01 les (magnitude and duration) of a biotherapeutic in serum and in immune organs may shift the balance between the induction of an immune response and tolerance. Because of the intended biological activity of immune modulators, the biological activity is directly linked to immunogenicity, such that ADA formation or lack thereof (a consequence of an immune response or tolerance, respectively) may be viewed as a PD readout. Special considerations for interdependencies in PK -effect relationships for biotherapeutics include disease-dependent changes in expression of the intended (or unintended) target that impact contribution of TMDD to the ADME pro /uniFB01 le. The context of usage impacts PK, effect, and the host immune response and adds another layer of complexity in their inexpediencies. The context of usage includes subject population (for example species, disease status, age, and sex), dosing regimen (dose level, route, duration of treatment), concomitant medications, as well as the manufacturing process and formulation. Impact of potential reciprocal assay interferences in PK and ADA readouts should also be taken into account for data interpretation.

which there is a time-dependent decrease in the apparent elimination rate of a drug caused by formation of drug/ADA complexes that are cleared at a slower rate compare to the drug not in complex with ADA. In addition to the ' real impact ' of ADAonPK, ADA may interfere in the PK assay, such that an apparent rapid concentration drop may be a consequence of this interference. A ' real PK impact ' of ADA usually correlates with a biological effect (PD, ef /uniFB01 cacy, and/or toxicity), while an apparent PK impact caused by assay interference may have a lower impact on PD, except in cases where there is a strong neutralizing component in ADA and drug concentrations are relatively low. ADA impact on PD of a therapeutic protein includes neutralization of biological activity or introduction of newbiological activity. New biological activity in some cases also may lead to toxicity: for example, IC deposition in the kidney, crosslinking-dependent signaling (leading to agonistic effects and/or cytokine storm), effector function mediated by ADA in complex with a therapeutic protein (leading to hypersensitivity reactions or depletion of target-expressing cells), and immune reaction to or neutralization of an endogenous protein (especially if a biotherapeutic is constructed using moieties/sequences that are expressed in the study population) (5).

PK and PD are also likely to affect ADA pro /uniFB01 les, due to either the actual biology of the system ( ' real ' impact of PK or PD on ADA, Fig. 2) or an interference caused by the drug in ADA assay readouts (or both). In particular, for immunomodulatory drugs (including both immunosuppressants and immunoactivators), the ADA formation (or lack thereof) may be viewed as a PD readout. In cases where the drug interferes in the ADA assay (such that there is a false-negative result in the ADAassay), changes in PK and PD may be used as alternative indicators of ADA formation. Optimization of assay conditions to minimize drug interference or employment of orthogonal methods may be used to con /uniFB01 rm the presence of ADAs (4,6). For immunosuppressants, there may be an inverse dose response for the induction of ADAs, which may be related to suboptimal pharmacological activity at lower dose levels (providing a more permissive environment for ADA development) or more potent pharmacological activity (i.e., immunosuppression, resulting in the downregulation of the immune response against the drug itself) and/or development of tolerance at higher dose levels. Furthermore, some therapeutic proteins for the treatment of autoimmune conditions are administered in combination with small molecule immunomodulators (such as azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, methotrexate, cyclosporin A), which can introduce even more complexity in the dose -response relationship for the immunogenicity response and its subsequent effect on the PK/PD pro /uniFB01 le, as well as issues concerning translation from animals to humans. Below, we provide examples of nonclinical and clinical studies of therapeutic proteins for the treatment of autoimmune conditions that illustrate the interdependencies and challenges described above.

## Case Study 1: Anti-IL-21R Abs

An example of the interdependency between PK, PD, and immunogenicity pro /uniFB01 les, as well as inverse dose response for induction of ADAs, is described for the neutralizing antiIL-21R antibodies that are being investigated for the treatment of autoimmune conditions (7). The pharmacological

activities and PK pro /uniFB01 les of two different human anti-IL-21R antibodies (referred to as Ab-01 and Ab-02) that differ in their in vitro potency and PK were examined in the MRLFas lpr mouse model of lupus. The results indicated that only the more potent anti-IL-21R antibody (Ab-01) was able to elicit a full pharmacological effect, and this effect was also associated with lower or delayed ADA levels and slower clearance, compared to Ab-02 and also compared to the same antibody (Ab-01) administered at suboptimal doses.

Speci /uniFB01 cally, when Ab-01 was administered at 10 mg/kg three times per week (TIW) for 12 weeks to MRL-Fas lpr mice, signi /uniFB01 cant reductions in both a biomarker of disease (anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies) and IgG deposits in the kidney were observed. At this pharmacologically active dose level of 10 mg/kg, trough median serum Ab-01 concentrations were higher than predicted based on a single-dose PK pro /uniFB01 le (assuming linearity), and ADA titers appeared lower compared to those in the isotype control group (Fig. 3); however, it should be noted that circulating Ab-01 might have interfered in the ADA assay. When Ab-01 was administered at 2.5 or 5 mg/kg TIW for 12 weeks, only a partial pharmacological response was observed (with no reduction in IgG deposits in the kidney). At these subef /uniFB01 cacious dose levels, median trough serum Ab-01 concentrations were either below the limit of quantitation (LOQ) or relatively low (i.e., decreased in more than a doseproportional manner compared to the corresponding values in the 10 mg/kg group). Speci /uniFB01 cally, in the 5-mg/kg group, median trough Ab-01 concentrations were above the LOQ only for the /uniFB01 rst 4 weeks of treatment, while in the 2.5mg/kg group, these values were below the LOQ at all time points tested (Fig. 3). All trough samples in the 2.5and 5-mg/kg group tested positive for ADA in a screening assay (titers were not determined for these dose levels; Vugmeyster et al. , unpublished observations). Overall, the more pharmacologically effective dose of Ab-01 was also associated with lower or delayed ADA levels and slower clearance.

Although both Ab-01 and Ab-02 had biological activity in mouse and human IL-21-dependent cell-based assays, Ab02 had lower potency in mouse cell-based assays. After a single 10-mg/kg IP dose to MRL-Fas lpr mice, Ab-02 had ~2 -3fold lower exposure compared to Ab-01, and both antibodies had a sharp decline in the terminal phase, coincidental with the development of ADA. In contrast to Ab-01, Ab-02 administered at 20 mg/kg (or 10 mg/kg) TIW for 12 weeks had no signi /uniFB01 cant pharmacological activity in the MRL-Fas lpr mouse model of lupus. Trough median serum concentrations of Ab-02 given at 20 mg/kg were relatively low (compared to those of Ab-01 given at the pharmacologically active dose of 10 mg/kg) for the /uniFB01 rst 4 weeks and below the LOQ after 4 weeks (Fig. 3). ADA titers in mice treated with 10 or 20 mg/kg of anti-Ab-02 TIW for 12 weeks (or with a control human IgG) were 10 -100-fold higher than those measured in animals treated with 10 mg/kg Ab-01 for 12 weeks.

The absence of pharmacological activity of Ab-02 in the MRL-Fas lpr model may be a consequence of both rapid elimination (likely driven by both ADA-dependent and ADA-independent clearance mechanisms) and insuf /uniFB01 cient potency in blocking the effects of mouse IL-21R. Because IL21 has a critical role in primary antibody responses (8), it is

Twelve-week-old MRLFas lpr mice were administered anti-IL-21R antibody Ab-01 (10, 5, or 2.5 mg/kg), anti-IL-21R antibody Ab-02 (20 or 10 mg/kg), or an isotype control antibody (10 mg/kg) by intraperitoneal (IP) injection three times per week over 10 weeks and sacri /uniFB01 ced ~3 days after the last dose. Serum was collected prior to dosing (week 0) and then at 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 weeks post-dose. Sera were analyzed for test article concentration (panel A ), anti-dsDNA biomarker (panel B ), and ADAs (panel C ) by immunoassays.

IgG deposits in the kidney sections were assessed by immunohistochemistry at sacri /uniFB01 ce (not shown), and only the 10mg/kg Ab-01 dose group showed signi /uniFB01 cant reduction in IgG deposits (referred to as ' full activity ' ).

plausible that an antibody that neutralizes IL-21R effectively upon repeated dosing also reduces or delays the development of ADA against itself, which in turn would lead to slower elimination of this antibody compared to a less potent antiIL-21 Ab or to suboptimal dose regimens for the same

antibody. This effect may be enhanced in a mouse strain such as MRL-Fas lpr , which is prone to autoimmune disease and polyclonal B cell expansion, and also has fast elimination of normal IgG, possibly due to the disease-induced impairment of the function of the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) (9).

## Case Study 2: Anti-TNF Antibody CDP571

Another example of the complex interdependency between PK and immunogenicity pro /uniFB01 les (including an inverse dose response for induction of ADA, species differences in these relationships, and an impact of concomitant medications) and ultimately the translation challenges are described for a humanized anti-TNF antibody CDP571. In single-dose studies of CDP571 in normal human volunteers (NHVs), ADAs exhibited an inverse dose response and had no pronounced impact on PK, and based on further characterization, the risk of increased ADA response upon chronic dosing was deemed low. In repeat dosing studies in autoimmune patients, ADA frequency was relatively low. However, since the patients were on concomitant immunosuppressive medications that affected multiple study endpoints including incidence of ADA, it was not possible to conclude that the prediction of low risk of increased ADA response was con /uniFB01 rmed. Species differences are highlighted by the /uniFB01 nding that, in contrast to NHVs, in single-dose monkey studies of CDP571, ADAs had a signi /uniFB01 cant impact on PK, and an isotype class switch was observed, despite the fact that a major ADA epitope appeared the same in NHVs and monkeys.

Speci /uniFB01 cally, during preclinical and early clinical development, CDP571 was administered via a single IV infusion to NHVs and cynomolgus monkeys at doses ranging from 0.1 to 10 mg/kg (10). ADAs were detectable in all NHVs receiving 0.1 mg/kg CDP571, but the frequency and titer decreased with increasing dose (i.e., an inverse dose response for induction of ADAs). ADA response in NHVs was characterized as weak, transient, mostly of IgM isotype, non-neutralizing, and, in general, speci /uniFB01 c for a certain epitope (with no ADA response detectable to the constant or framework regions of CDP571). The authors used these ADA characterization data, as well as the observation of the decreasing ADA response at higher (therapeutically relevant) doses, as an argument of potential feasibility of chronic therapy with CDP571, since the risk of increased ADA response upon repeated dosing was deemed relatively low. In contrast to NHVs, after a single dose of CDP571 to cynomolgus monkeys, IgM to IgG isotype class switch for ADAs was detected in a majority of the animals, and ADAs appeared to have a more pronounced impact on PK pro /uniFB01 les, compared to NHVs. However, as in humans, ADAs were, in general, speci /uniFB01 c for the same conformational epitope. In both monkeys and NHVs, the authors attributed the reduced anti-CDP571 response at higher dosages to induction of tolerance rather than sustained immunosuppression. These CDP571 studies in monkeys and NHVs highlight the dif /uniFB01 culty in extrapolating the impact of ADAs on PK pro /uniFB01 les from monkeys to humans, even in the cases when the majority of ADAresponse is considered to be directed to the same epitope.

In the subsequent repeated dosing studies of CDP571 in humans with CD (two separate clinical trials), a relatively low percentage of patients were ADA positive (~6 -11%) (11,12). However, it is not possible to conclude that the prediction of a low risk of increased ADA response (made based on the single-dose data in NHVs) was con /uniFB01 rmed, because an interpretation of repeated dosing data may have been confounded by the concomitant immunosuppressive medications that affected the ADA pro /uniFB01 le (as well as ef /uniFB01 cacy, safety, and PK). While the co-administration of immunosuppressive

medications appeared to correlate with lower ADA frequency within each clinical trial, the overall and subgroup-speci /uniFB01 c frequencies of ADA response were variable across the two trials. These studies illustrate additional complexities in interpretation of PK, PD, and ADA data of immunosuppressive proteins that are co-administered with other immunosuppressive medications and the need for an integrated interpretation of ADA impact on study results.

## Case Study 3: Anti-CD4 Antibody MTRX1011A

Preexisting antibodies to some therapeutic proteins, which tend to be more prevalent in the disease population than in NHVs, are an emerging issue that contributes to potential ADA impact on PK/PD pro /uniFB01 les and may complicate data interpretation and translation of PK/PD and ADA pro /uniFB01 les from NHVs to patients with an autoimmune disease. Preexisting antibody reactivity may be caused by exposure to related biotherapeutics or environmental antigens or may be naturally occurring antibodies. An example of the confounding impact of preexisting reactivity and disease status on interpretation of PK/PD data is presented for a humanized nondepleting anti-CD4 antibody MTRX1011A.

MTRX1011A contains a mutation in the Fc region (N434H) designed to improve MTRX1011A binding to FcRn and thereby decreases the nonspeci /uniFB01 c systemic elimination rate (Kel) and increases exposure (13). Preexisting (IgM) antibodies that recognize N434H in MTRX1011A were detected in approximately 70% of RA patients but not in NHVs or baboons. In baboons, the bene /uniFB01 t of incorporating N434H mutation on serum PK was clearly demonstrated compared to the parent chimeric anti-CD4 antibody TRX1 that had no FcRn modulating mutation (13). However, the impact of N434H mutation on human Kel could not be demonstrated. Authors indicate that comparison of PK/PD data for TRX1 and MTRX1011A in humans was confounded by the differences in populations used for the /uniFB01 rst-in-human studies, which were RA for MTRX1011A and of NHVs for TRX. These differences in study subjects are especially important because of the potential impact of disease status on the PK/PD properties of these antibodies: in part because of the signi /uniFB01 cant contribution of target-mediated disposition, as well as because of the high prevalence of preexisting ADAs for MTRX1011A in RA populations but not for TRX1 in NHVs. While very few patients developed non-IgM antiMTRX1011A antibodies post MTRX1011A treatment and there was no apparent relationship between ADA status (both IgM and non-IgM) and PK of MTRX1011A, the authors suggested that some of the anti-MTRX1011A reactivity might be partially neutralizing with respect to the expected bene /uniFB01 cial attenuation of FcRn binding. The authors indicated that the cross-population comparison and test article choice were not optimal for testing the bene /uniFB01 ts of the FcRn modulating mutation in humans, and therefore, further studies would be required to test the bene /uniFB01 t of N434H in humans.

In summary, for immunomodulatory/immunosuppressive biotherapeutics, special consideration should be given to assessment of the interdependency of ADME, PK/PD, and immunogenicity (including preexisting reactivity) pro /uniFB01 les across various preclinical species and humans, including both the interdependencies in biology and assay readouts. The

differences in the context of usage (such as dosing regimens, disease status, and concomitant medications) may affect immunogenicity pro /uniFB01 les and its impact on ADME and PK/ PD pro /uniFB01 les. Because of the above complexities and interdependences, it is essential to interpret PK, PD, and ADA readouts and ultimately human ef /uniFB01 cacy and safety data in an integrated manner.

## DISTRIBUTION TO NORMAL VERSUS DISEASE TISSUE

Several recent studies report differences in tissue penetration of macromolecules in normal versus in /uniFB02 amed tissues and exemplify the potential importance and challenges of addressing tissue penetration of different biotherapeutic modalities for treatmentofin /uniFB02 ammatory conditions in the disease (in /uniFB02 amed) settings. Palframan et al. examined uptake of several TNF inhibitors into the paws of healthy mice and in /uniFB02 amed paws of mice with collagen-induced arthritis (CIA), a mouse model of RA(14). Speci /uniFB01 cally, healthy and CIA mice were injected with asingle2mg/kgIVdoseof /uniFB02 uorescently labeled certolizumab pegol (PEGylated recombinant, humanized anti-TNF Fab ' ), adalimumab (a recombinant human anti-TNF mAb), or in /uniFB02 iximab (a chimeric anti-TNF mAb), and paw uptake was quanti /uniFB01 ed using a noninvasive bio /uniFB02 uorescence imaging method. All three TNF inhibitors distributed more effectively into the in /uniFB02 amed tissue than the nonin /uniFB02 amed tissues in this animal model of arthritis. Similar differences in tissue penetration of these TNF inhibitors into in /uniFB02 amed versus nonin /uniFB02 amed mouse tissues were also obtained in the DSS-induced animal model of IBD relative to the control healthy mice (15).

It is likely that in many cases, the relative impact of ADAs on tissue distribution and resulting tissue exposure will be different between the healthy and disease subjects and that these relative differences cannot be directly extrapolated from serum pro /uniFB01 les. As an example, for the anti-IL-21R antibody Ab-01 (mentioned in Case Study 1), biodistribution studies were conducted in wild type and MRL-FAS lpr lupusprone mice following a single dose of 125 I-labeled drug (16). Although both the serum and tissue Ab-01 concentrations were lower in MRL-FAS lpr mice than in healthy mice, the difference between serum and tissue drug concentrations was more pronounced in the lupus-prone animals. Although ADA likely was a major cause of these differences, other strain and disease-speci /uniFB01 c factors have likely contributed including the increased receptor-mediated clearance and/or tissue uptake (due to expansion of IL-21R-expressing lymphoid cells in MRLFAS lpr mice), impaired FcRn function, and/or increased vascular permeability (9,17). It should be noted that similar to the impact of ADAs, effects of altered target expression and/or increased vascular permeability may not always be evident from serum PK pro /uniFB01 les, even in cases where there is a signi /uniFB01 cant impact of these factors on distribution, as exempli /uniFB01 ed by the biodistribution study of anti-RAGE Ab in target-expressing and knockout mice (18).

Similar considerations related to disease status apply for characterization of retention pro /uniFB01 les of locally administered biotherapeutics, for example intra-articular (IA) injections for various arthritic conditions or intradermal injection for psoriasis or atopic dermatitis. In a recent study, disposition of 125 I-labeled recombinant human lubricin ([ 125 I]LUB:1) was

examined in normal rats and in the rat meniscal tear model of post-traumatic arthritis following a single IA injection (19). Micro-autoradiography analysis of tissue sections suggested that [ 125 I]LUB:1 tended to localize to damaged joint surfaces in rats with meniscal tear; however, no differences in total knee counts between healthy and operated rats were noted.

In humans, due to ethical considerations, side-by-side comparisons of tissue penetration of a therapeutic protein in healthy versus in /uniFB02 amed tissues are usually not available. In addition, there is a paucity of data on tissue penetration in in /uniFB02 ammatory/autoimmune patients, because of both the logistics of sample availability and limitations in bioanalytical methodologies. In one study conducted nearly 40 years ago, catabolism and serum-synovial transport of a puri /uniFB01 ed rheumatoid factor were examined in patients with in /uniFB02 ammatory joint disease, and this study suggested that in this patient population, the synovial membrane offers little barrier to antibody transport (20). Further studies with several TNF inhibitors indicated that concentrations of these therapeutic proteins in synovial /uniFB02 uid of RA patients is 30 -100% of that in serum (21, 22). Penetration into the brain is an especially challenging but highly relevant problem when considering the number of indications with the site of action in the central nervous system. For example, rituximab (an anti-CD20 Ab) and alemtuzumab (an anti-CD52 antibody) are currently being developed for the treatment of MS (23). However, in the case of rituximab, the steady-state cerebrospinal /uniFB02 uid levels in MS patients are reported as <0.25% to <0.1% of serum levels (23). It should be noted that for mAbs that are being explored for neurological indications, it is not known whether brain penetration is required for ef /uniFB01 cacy, since pharmacological activity in the periphery (e.g., B cell depletion by rituximab) may be the main driver for the clinical endpoints.

In general, several factors may explain the differences in tissue penetration of therapeutic proteins in normal versus in /uniFB02 amed tissues (Box 1). In /uniFB02 amed tissues tend to have a disrupted endothelium (24), which means there is less of a barrier to passive diffusion compared to normal tissue. In addition, in autoimmune conditions such as RA, new vessel formation at the site of in /uniFB02 ammation has been reported, providing additional mechanistic basis for the apparent increased vascular permeability of macromolecules in RA (reviewed in (25)). Also, for biotherapeutics that target various components of the immune system, the target expression may be higher in in /uniFB02 amed tissues, including both an upregulation of target expression per cell and an increase in the number of target-expressing cells (related to increased vascular permeability and chronic in /uniFB02 ammatory cell in /uniFB01 ltration, as well as to chronic lymphoproliferative responses), which means that there may be a target-dependent tissue retention or uptake of an immunomodulatory therapeutic. The differences in lymphatic drainage and in the impact of ADA on tissue pro /uniFB01 les (as mentioned above) (16) in normal versus in /uniFB02 amed settings have also been reported (26,27). Thus, the mechanistic basis for differences in penetration between the normal and in /uniFB02 amed tissues is likely to vary with the biotherapeutic modality being employed, and an understanding of these mechanisms is crucial for engineering of the next generation of biotherapeutics with improved tissue penetration to the site of action. It is expected that the application of emerging noninvasive quantitative imaging

technologies would be instrumental in advancing our knowledge in tissue penetration of biotherapeutics in humans, including addressing differences between healthy and in /uniFB02 amedstates. The follow-up challenge would be investigating and establishing the clinical relevance (including impact on dosing regimens) of these potential tissue penetration differences.

## QUEST FOR HALF-LIFE EXTENSION

The autoimmune and in /uniFB02 ammatory disease market for biological therapies is one of the most competitive in the industry, with more than 30 proteins approved and hundreds of therapeutic proteins in various stages of development (Table I and (1,28)). Because of the persistent nature of autoimmune and in /uniFB02 ammatory conditions, chronic treatments are needed to adequately manage these diseases. Furthermore, identical or similar targets and/or active moieties are often being exploited by different pharmaceutical companies (Table I). Therefore, the PK/PD pro /uniFB01 le, target af /uniFB01 nities, and formulations that are compatible with infrequent dosing delivered by routes amenable to self-administration (most commonly subcutaneous [SC] but also intramuscular [IM]) provide a clear commercial advantage and are used to de /uniFB01 ne target product pro /uniFB01 les during development. In general, there are multiple approaches to attenuate the half-life of a therapeutic protein, and the state of the art in half-life extension (HLE) of therapeutic proteins has been recently extensively reviewed (29). A signi /uniFB01 cant amount of ADME-centric protein engineering and subsequent in vivo validations and investigations are being conducted for biotherapeutics intended for autoimmune or other in /uniFB02 ammatory conditions. Below, we focus on the classic examples and emerging science in this /uniFB01 eld.

## Fc Engineering

One of the earliest and most common approaches for HLE is the attachment of an Fc domain to gain protection from endosomal degradation by taking advantage of FcRn recycling (reviewed in (30 -32)). Enbrel, comprised of a soluble TNF receptor (p75) fused to the Fc domain of a human IgG1 and developed to treat RA was the /uniFB01 rst Fc-fusion protein to be marketed (33). The modern version of this approach is mutating the FcRn binding site to gain half-life extension beyond that for wild-type IgGs (reviewed in (30 -32)). As mentioned above (Case Study 3), the /uniFB01 rst FcRn-engineered antibody reported to be administered to humans is an anti-CD4 antibody MTRX1011A for RA (13).

While signi /uniFB01 cant knowledge has been acquired on the impact of the FcRn-site engineering on serum half-lives of Fc-

containing biotherapeutics, the impact of these mutations on biodistribution and SC absorption is an emerging research /uniFB01 eld. Wang et al. provided initial evidence for the role of FcRn on SC absorption of an antibody: for a model antiplatelet antibody 7E3, the systemic bioavailability after a SC dose was â¼ 3-fold higher in WT mice than in FcRnde /uniFB01 cient mice (34). Deng et al. compared SC absorption pro /uniFB01 les of a wild-type anti-TNF Ab IgG and two FcRnengineered variants (N434A and N434H) in both mice and monkeys (35). While some differences in SC absorption parameters between the wild-type and FcRn-engineered variants of an anti-TNF Ab were noted and hypotheses to explain these differences were proposed, mechanistic studies to understand the role of FcRn in SC absorption of antibodies remain to be conducted. Comprehensive evaluation of the contribution of FcRn to transport of IgGs, likewise, needs to be carried out. It is likely that biotherapeutic candidates for the treatment of autoimmune conditions that have been engineered to contain FcRn mutations, such as anti-TNF and anti-CD4 mAbs described above, will be used as model compounds for these studies (13,35).

## PEGylation

Attachment of a polyethylene glycol (PEG) polymer is commonly used to prolong in vivo exposure of therapeutic proteins. Different PEGs ranging in size from 1 up to 50 kDa and also differing in site and chemistry of attachment are available, and all result in some improvement in serum halflife, ranging from a 4-fold to a nearly 1,000-fold longer halflife compared to the unconjugated protein (reviewed in (36 -39)). Two basic mechanisms are likely to contribute to the effect of PEGylation on PK pro /uniFB01 les of therapeutic proteins: reduction in renal clearance through increased overall size/ molecular weight and masking of the proteolytic sites on the therapeutic protein (reviewed in (37,38,40)). It is believed that protein -PEG conjugates with larger size and/or hydrodynamic volume of PEG (and in some but not all cases, PEGs with a higher degree of branching) are more likely to have higher serum exposures (39,41 -43). However, since the loss of biological activity may be an unwanted consequence of PEGylation, the optimal PEG structure may vary for different therapeutic proteins (40).

PEGylated interferonÎ± (IFNÎ± ) for treatment of chronic hepatitis C, Peg-Intron, was one of the /uniFB01 rst approved PEGylated products. Currently, there are two different FDA-approved PEGylated interferon alpha treatments: PegIntron, a conjugate of recombinant IFNÎ± 2b and a linear 12kDa PEG, and Pegasys, a conjugate of IFNÎ± 2a and a 40-kDa PEG. Both Peg-Intron and Pegasys are administered via weekly SC injections and are recommended to be used in combination with ribavirin (reviewed in (44) and Table I). The mean terminal half-life after SC dosing in patients with chronic hepatitis C appears shorter for PEG-Intron (~40 h) compared to Pegasys (~80 h), which is consistent with the difference in PEG size between the two conjugates (45,46). It should be noted that in comparative clinical trials at the approved dose regimens, Pegasys and PEG-Intron had comparable ef /uniFB01 cacy and safety pro /uniFB01 les (47).

Similar to the case for FcRn engineering, the impact of PEGylation on ADME properties of biotherapeutics beyond

serum half-life extension is not well understood. The pioneering studies on the impact of PEGylation on biodistribution were performed for certolizumab pegol (Cimzia), which is the PEGylated recombinant humanized anti-TNF Fab ' and is the /uniFB01 rst antibody fragment approved for clinical use (indicated for CD and RA, Table I). The /uniFB02 uorescent imaging study in mice by Palframan et al. to address biodistribution of certolizumab pegol and anti-TNF IgGs is outlined in the previous section (14). In this study, the ratio of penetration of certolizumab pegol into arthritic paws compared with normal paws was greater than that observed with the two different anti-TNF IgGs, although all three anti-TNF inhibitors had more ef /uniFB01 cient penetration into in /uniFB02 amed paws. Furthermore, the accumulation of certolizumab pegol in in /uniFB02 amed paws was more responsive to the severity of in /uniFB02 ammation when compared with the anti-TNF IgGs. The authors suggested that these differences in tissue penetration of certolizumab pegol compared to anti-TNF IgGs were conferred on the molecule by PEGylation. However, since different active antiTNF moieties were used for the Fc-based versus the PEGbased HLE approaches, this hypothesis needs to be con/uniFB01 rmed by additional experiments. Nevertheless, this study suggested that the differences in tissue penetration between various HLE approaches may be more pronounced in the disease settings.

The studies that address the impact of PEG characteristics (such as size, degree of branching, and attachment site) on tissue penetration of protein -PEG conjugates are sparse. Yamoka et al. showed differences in tissue uptake for naked (non-protein attached) PEG molecules of different molecular weight after IV administration in mice (42,43). A recent case study with a PEGylated TNF-binding Nanobody suggested that the impact of the degree of PEG branching on tissue distribution may not necessarily parallel the impact on serum PK (48). In this study, mice were given a single IV injection of 125 I-labeled anti-TNF Nanobody conjugated to either linear or branched 40-kDa PEG and serum PK, and tissue penetration in normal mice was examined. While serum exposure was higher for the branched TNF Nanobody -PEG conjugate, the tissue exposure in some organs (e.g . , spleen) was similar between these two constructs.

Hu et al. studied the differences in absorption kinetics of PEG -IFN Î² -1a, following IM versus SC administration to rhesus monkeys (49). PEG -IFN Î² -1a is a second-generation IFN Î² -1a -20-kDa PEG conjugate and is currently in phase III studies for the treatment of MS, with the goal of decreasing the frequency of administration compared to the approved unconjugated IFN Î² -1a (Anovex, Table I). In rhesus monkeys, PEG -IFN Î² -1a was absorbed more quickly after a single IM injection (evident by earlier T max and higher C max), such that the absorption rate constant ( k a) for the SC route was 5-fold lower than that for the IM route. The difference in k a between IM and SC routes in rhesus monkeys appears to be unique to the PEGylated IFN Î² -1a, since the reported T max for non-PEGylated IFN Î² -1a in rhesus monkeys was similar between the IM and SC routes. However, the route differences between the absorption kinetics of PEGylated IFN Î² -1a in rhesus monkeys did not translate to humans (50), again highlighting the challenges in translating ADME pro /uniFB01 les from animals to humans, especially for novel modalities.

## Albumin Binding

Attachment of albumin/albumin-binding domains (such as nanobodies, albumin-binding domain derived from streptococcal protein G [ABD], and other albumin-binding peptides) is another HLE approach, which provides protection from degradation through FcRn recycling, conceptually similar to the Fc-fusion approach (reviewed in (31)). Zablin, the human albumin fusion protein that has advanced the farthest clinically, is a genetic fusion of human albumin and interferonÎ± 2b developed for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C. The desired product pro /uniFB01 le for Zalbin included requirement for less frequent injections (administered every 2 weeks (Q2W) in clinical trials (51)) compared to the previously discussed competitor products Peg-Intron and Pegasys (approved for weekly dosing (QW (45,46)). Zablin submission was not approved by the FDA (because of the risk/bene /uniFB01 t pro /uniFB01 le), and development was stopped.

As noted above for Fc engineering and PEGylation, there is little knowledge on the impact of fusing albumin or an albumin-binding domain to a biotherapeutic on the absorption kinetics or biodistribution beyond the expected decrease in systemic elimination. Andersen et al. reported that in healthy rats, the ABD molecule fused to epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2)-targeting af /uniFB01 body had a serum half-life and biodistribution pro /uniFB01 le similar to that of rat serum albumin (RSA) alone (52). Interestingly, these data also suggested that distribution of this ABD fusion or RSA shows a more rapid and wider distribution compared to that of a typical IgG. Coppieters et al. assessed distribution of a 125 I-labeled Nanobody fusion construct comprised of anti-mouse TNF and anti-albumin Nanobodies in arthritic mice (CIA mouse model or RA) (53). In this study, accumulation of radioactivity in in /uniFB02 amed paws was detected (using a gamma camera); however, no suitable control groups were included to assess the speci /uniFB01 c contribution of the albumin-binding nanobody. Studies by Bocci et al. showed that when albumin is added to an IFNÎ± formulation, it acts as an interstitial /uniFB02 uid expander, thus favoring interferon absorption through lymphatics rather than blood capillaries, suggesting that albumin may in /uniFB02 uence SC absorption pathways of macromolecules (54,55).

In summary, because of the chronic nature of the diseases and the competitive landscape in autoimmune and in /uniFB02 ammatory markets, many pioneering investigations on ADME-driven protein engineering approaches are being conducted with biotherapeutics in this therapeutic area. While signi /uniFB01 cant knowledge has been acquired on the HLE capabilities of various modalities with respect to the serum PK pro /uniFB01 le, the impact on tissue distribution and absorption, as well as translation of ADME properties of novel modalities from animals to humans, is an emerging area of research.

## CONCLUSION

Optimization of ADME and PK/PD pro /uniFB01 les of protein therapeutics intended for the treatment of autoimmune and other in /uniFB02 ammatory conditions often requires creative approaches to protein engineering, ADME study designs, and bioanalysis. Special consideration should be given to the assessment of the interdependency of PK, PD, distribution, and immunogenicity pro /uniFB01 les across various preclinical species

and humans, including animal and human subjects with different status of disease, in /uniFB02 ammation, and concomitant medications. Along these lines, emerging questions include assessments of a preexisting reactivity to a biotherapeutic in disease populations and its impact on PK and PD pro /uniFB01 les, as well as analysis of distribution to normal versus in /uniFB02 amed tissue, including contributions of target-mediated mechanisms, increased vascular permeability, differences in lymphatic drainage, and impact of ADA. Due to complexities and interdependences in underlying biology and assay readouts for PK, PD, and ADA pro /uniFB01 les of biotherapeutics intended for treatment of autoimmune or in /uniFB02 ammatory conditions, these data need to be interpreted in an integrated manner.

In addition, many pioneering ADME investigations on new approaches to extend the serum and the site-of-action exposures are being conducted for biotherapeutics in this therapeutic area, in part because treatment of in /uniFB02 ammatory conditions requires chronic treatments and drug penetration to the tissues and, in part, due to strong competitive pressure in this market. To date, signi /uniFB01 cant knowledge has been acquired on serum half-life extension capabilities of various approaches, including Fc engineering, PEGylation, and fusion to albumin-binding domains. On the other hand, characterization and reliable prediction (based on preclinical and/or in vitro data) of absorption and tissue penetration pro /uniFB01 les of these new constructs are an emerging science, which holds great promise for optimizing ef /uniFB01 cacy and providing commercial advantage in the /uniFB01 eld of autoimmune and other in /uniFB02 ammatory diseases.

However, similar to any therapeutic area in which biotherapeutic modalities are pursued, one of the most challenging tasks ahead is linking novel methodologies, investigations, and/or data analysis strategy to a clinically relevant endpoint.
