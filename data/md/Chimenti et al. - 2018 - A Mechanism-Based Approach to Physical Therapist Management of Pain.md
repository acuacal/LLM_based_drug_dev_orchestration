## A Mechanism-Based Approach to Physical Therapist Management of Pain

Ruth L. Chimenti, Laura A. Frey-Law, Kathleen A. Sluka

Pain reduction is a primary goal of physical therapy for patients who present with acute or persistent pain conditions. The purpose of this review is to describe a mechanism-based approach to physical therapy pain management. It is increasingly clear that patients need to be evaluated for changes in peripheral tissues and nociceptors, neuropathic pain signs and symptoms, reduced central inhibition and enhanced central excitability, psychosocial factors, and alterations of the movement system. In this Perspective, 5 categories of pain mechanisms (nociceptive, central, neuropathic, psychosocial, and movement system) are de/fined, and principles on how to evaluate signs and symptoms for each mechanism are provided. In addition, the underlying mechanisms targeted by common physical therapist treatments and how they affect each of the 5 categories are described. Several different mechanisms can simultaneously contribute to a patient's pain; alternatively, 1 or 2 primary mechanisms may cause a patient's pain. Further, within a single pain mechanism, there are likely many possible subgroups. For example, reduced central inhibition does not necessarily correlate with enhanced central excitability. To individualize care, common physical therapist interventions, such as education, exercise, manual therapy, and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, can be used to target speci/fic pain mechanisms. Although the evidence elucidating these pain mechanisms will continue to evolve, the approach outlined here provides a conceptual framework for applying new knowledge as advances are made.

W hether acute or chronic, pain is a leading reason for patients to seek  physical therapy.  Approximately  100  million Americans suffer from persistent pain. 1 The cost of persistent pain in America,  including  decreased  productivity at work and health care, is estimated between $560 and $635 billion, which is greater than cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes combined. 2 The Department of Health and Human Services recently published a National Pain Strategy, 3 highlighting the insuf/ficient training in pain assessment and treatment for many clinicians. The National Institutes of Health and the Interagency Pain  Research  Coordinating  Committee also recently published the Federal Pain Research Strategy, which identi/fied as a top priority the need to develop, evaluate, and improve models of pain care. 4 Accordingly, the purpose of this article is to provide an overview of a mechanism-based approach to physical therapy pain management that includes the evaluation and treatment of 5 pain mechanisms: nociceptive, central, neuropathic, psychosocial, and movement system. Recently, the International Association for the Study of Pain (www. iasp-pain.org)  released  a  new  term, nociplastic , designed to be a third descriptor to be used instead of 'central' or  'central  sensitization.'    Nociplastic pain is de/fined as pain that arises from  altered  nociception  despite  no clear evidence of actual or threatened tissue damage causing the activation of peripheral nociceptors or evidence for disease or lesion of the somatosensory system causing the pain.

A mechanism-based approach to pain management incorporates and builds on the biopsychosocial model by de/fining  speci/fic  pathobiology  in  pain processing,  pain-relevant  psychological factors, and movement system dysfunction. The term 'pain mechanisms' is used to delineate factors that can contribute to the development, maintenance, or enhancement of pain. Further, these pain mechanisms can also occur in a cyclical manner in reaction to the pain. A patient may have multiple pain mechanisms occurring simultaneously, and 2 individuals with the same

diagnosis could have different underlying mechanisms contributing to their pain. Accordingly, a mechanism-based approach requires evaluating speci/fic pain mechanisms as well as prescribing the appropriate treatments to target altered  mechanism(s).  Although  each pain mechanism can be addressed individually, the ef/ficiency of an intervention may be maximized when multiple pain mechanisms are targeted simultaneously.

This  mechanism-based  approach  to care  is  common  in  pharmaceutical pain management. People with neuropathic pain are often prescribed gabapentinoids  because  of  their  ability to block calcium channel activity that is enhanced in this condition 5 ; people with  in/flammatory  nociceptive  pain are  often  prescribed  anti-in/flammatory  medications (eg,  nonsteroidal antiin/flammatory drugs and tumor necrosis factor inhibitors) 6 ; and those with nociplastic pain are often prescribed reuptake inhibitors to modulate central inhibition. 6 On the other hand, in physical therapy, many treatments evolved and were used clinically before we understood how they produced their effects. For example, initial clinical studies used transcutaneous  electrical  nerve  stimulation (TENS) to reduce pain in the 1960s, but we did not fully understand the mechanisms for how TENS reduces pain until this century. 7-19 What has emerged in recent years is the knowledge that many physical therapist interventions have multiple mechanisms of action and are thus considered multimodal pain treatments. For example, research shows that exercise can alter all  5  pain  mechanisms:  nociceptive, neuropathic, nociplastic, psychosocial, and movement system. 20-38

We have expanded the mechanism-based approach from the pathobiological processes only (ie, biomedical  model)  to  include  psychological and  movement  system  dysfunction. Recognizing  the  importance  of  pain mechanisms for individualizing care is not novel, 39-42 but has not been widely  implemented  in  physical  therapist practice.  This  article  will  provide  a brief overview of a mechanism-based

approach to pain management, including  several  evaluation  and  treatment options, and facilitate an appreciation for how these mechanisms may overlap and interact. Throughout this article the reader is referred to other sources providing detailed information on how to identify, evaluate, and treat individual  pain  mechanisms.  Bene/fits  of  a mechanism-based approach are that it expands physical therapist practice to include latest research from a number of /fields and enables the use of targeted interventions with the goal of optimizing outcomes. However, methods of pain mechanism assessment continue to evolve for clinical use and it is often dif/ficult to differentiate between pain mechanisms. With time, clinical tools will continue to develop to advance the mechanism-based  approach.  This  approach is also open to the integration of additional pain mechanisms as they are identi/fied with future research.

## Overview of Pain Mechanisms

The initiation, maintenance, and perception of pain is in/fluenced by biological,  psychosocial,  and  movement system factors (Fig. 1). Biological pain mechanisms can be categorized into 3 classes, including nociceptive (peripheral), nociplastic (nonnociceptive), and neuropathic (Fig 1A). 39,43,44 Pain often originates  in  the  peripheral  nervous system when nociceptors are activated due to an injury, in/flammation, or mechanical irritant. Nociceptive signals are relayed to the spinal cord and up to the cortex through ascending nociceptive pathways resulting in the perception of pain. Peripheral sensitization of nociceptive neurons can enhance or prolong the pain experience, even without sensitization of central neurons (Fig. 2). Accordingly, nociceptive pain is primarily due to nociceptor activation, albeit processed through the central nervous system  (CNS),  typically  resulting  in acute localized pain, such as an ankle sprain.  Within  the  CNS,  nociceptive signals are under constant modulation by cortical and brain-stem pathways, which can be facilitatory or inhibitory, and modulate both emotional and sensory components of pain. 45 Nociplastic pain  conditions are due to alterations of nociceptive processing, most  likely

within  the  CNS,  such  as  enhanced central excitability and/or diminished central inhibition, often  referred to  as  central  sensitization  (Fig.  2). Nociplastic  pain  is  typically  chronic and more widespread than  nociceptive pain, with  /fibromyalgia as the classic example. 12 Nociplastic pain can occur independently of  peripheral nociceptor activity; however, some conditions involve both nociceptive and nociplastic pain mechanisms (eg, peripheral and

central sensitization) to varying degrees along a continuum, such as low back pain or knee osteoarthritis (Fig. 3). 39 Pain  conditions  with  enhanced  peripheral and central sensitization may respond well to removal of only the peripheral input, which can eliminate central sensitization in some cases (eg, total knee replacement). However, removal  of  the  peripheral  input  may only have a partial effect with residual central sensitization causing  continued

pain. 12,39 Neuropathic pain occurs when there is a lesion or disease within the somatosensory  system. 39 This  could occur due to direct injury to the nerve, such as carpal tunnel syndrome, or due to metabolic diseases, such as diabetes. Nociceptive,  nociplastic,  and  neuropathic pain may not respond equally well to various treatments, thus, the understanding of underlying mechanisms will help to guide treatment choices aimed at these mechanisms.

These  3  biological  pain  processes can be in/fluenced by, as well as directly  in/fluence,  psychosocial  factors (Fig.  1B). 39,46 Addressing maladaptive psychosocial factors can maximize therapy  effectiveness  for  acute  and chronic  pain  conditions. 46,47 Negative emotionality factors, such as depression or fear avoidance beliefs, may augment other pain mechanisms and contribute to the maintenance of a painful condition. 47,48 Psychological factors are hypothesized to be critical in the transition from acute to chronic pain and predictive of the development of  chronic pain

In pain conditions, peripheral sensitization and central sensitization vary across a continuum. Sensitization of the peripheral nervous system contributes to a large proportion of pain with an acute localized injury, whereas sensitization of the central nervous system contributes to a large proportion of pain with chronic widespread pain conditions, such as fibromyalgia (FM). For other diagnoses, depicted in the midrange as low back pain (LBP), osteoarthritis (OA), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Achilles tendinopathy (AT), and temporomandibular joint disorder (TMD), people can have high levels of peripheral sensitization, high levels of central sensitization, or both.

postoperatively. 46,49-51 Therefore, therapeutic interventions often bene/fit from considering these psychosocial factors.

As physical therapists, evaluation and treatment of the movement system is a key component of our care for patients with pain. 52 Clearly, we recognize 'antalgic gait' patterns as movement in/fluenced by pain; overuse syndromes as painful conditions induced by repetitive movement; and the nociceptive withdrawal  re/flex  as  a  well-characterized link between afferent pain pathways and the efferent motor system. However, the relationships between pain and the movement system are complex and often highly variable between individuals. 53 Pain can produce increased muscle contraction, tone, or trigger points 54 ; it can result in muscle inhibition or fear-avoidance  behaviors  resulting  in disuse and disability, 55 or both facilitation and inhibition in opposing muscle groups. 56 Thus, targeted interventions may help reduce motor responses that exacerbate pain or improve function by minimizing the motor effects of pain. The integration of physical therapists' expertise in the movement system with the other pain mechanisms has the potential to elevate our level of care to more effectively evaluate and treat pain conditions.

## Evaluation of Pain Mechanisms

Evaluation  of  pain  mechanisms  can help  individualize  care  to  a  patient rather than a diagnosis, and is a step

/H18549

toward providing precision medicine to patients with pain. The use of anatomic or  radiographic  diagnoses  alone  (ie, medical model) without consideration of the underlying pain mechanism(s) (ie, enhanced biopsychosocial model) is  insuf/ficient  to  guide  rehabilitative care.  Although  peripheral  pathology is  linked  to  musculoskeletal  pain, 57 symptom  severity  can  be  modulated by  central  processing,  psychosocial factors, and the movement system. The common mismatch between tissue pathology and pain is supported by /findings among asymptomatic 80-year-olds, where 96% have signs of disk degeneration and 62% have rotator cuff tears on imaging. 58,59 In order to apply a mechanism-based approach, one must /first evaluate for signs and symptoms suggestive of changes in peripheral tissues and nociceptors, reduced central inhibition and/or enhanced central excitability, neuropathic pain signs and symptoms,  psychosocial  factors,  and altered movement patterns. Once the primary pain mechanism(s) are identi/fied, then a clinician can be more speci/fic with their overall assessment. For example, with patient referred for low back pain (anatomic region), the physical therapist may identify pain associated with fatigue and sleep dysfunction (central indicators), high kinesiophobia (psychosocial  factor),  and  abdominal muscle  weakness  (movement  system factor).  By  de/fining  the  mechanisms contributing to a patient's pain, a clinician can prioritize and target speci/fic

interventions to the primary pain mechanism(s).

Evaluation  of  biological  pain  mechanisms  is  informed  through  patientreported history, questionnaires, and  potentially  quantitative  sensory testing  (QST).  Unfortunately,  identi/fication of nociceptive, nociplastic, and   neuropathic pain mechanisms are not  directly measurable, but must be  inferred from indirect assessments. Nociceptive pain is indicated by pain localized to the area of tissue  injury within  normal  tissue  healing  time. Peripheral  factors  can  also  contribute  to  chronic  musculoskeletal  pain, but are more challenging to discern. Enhanced  peripheral sensitivity, such as primary hyperalgesia, can be detected by  lowered pressure pain thresholds at the site of injury compared to the   contralateral side. 60,61 However, interpretation of this test may be confounded by the presence of secondary hyperalgesia on the contralateral side, indicating  the  need  for  established norms in a pain-free population. Nociplastic pain conditions include more diffuse symptoms such as widespread pain,  fatigue,  sleep  dysfunction,  and cognitive  disturbances,  but  can  also involve relatively isolated pain due to altered CNS processing, such as secondary hyperalgesia or referred pain. 62 Researchers use several QST measures to identify altered pain processing, 60,63 which may have clinical utility once further  developed  and  characterized. Enhanced central excitability can be assessed by enhanced pain response to a repetitive noxious stimulus (eg, von Frey /filament for 10-30 s), referred to as  temporal  summation  of  pain. 60,64 However, temporal summation is also a normal response to repetitive noxious stimulation, 64 and as yet we do not have normative values to indicate an enhanced response for clinical populations. Pain inhibition is evaluated using a conditioned pain modulation (CPM) test, which employs a 'pain  inhibits pain' modulation. CPM measures pain thresholds at a distant site during/after a conditioning noxious stimulus (eg, pressure pain threshold of leg during immersion of hand in ice-cold water). 65 Most pain-free individuals exhibit

increased pain thresholds (less sensitivity), whereas in chronic pain  conditions there are often reduced or no change in pain thresholds. 63 Currently, limitations to using QST as a clinical indicator are the lack of both norms to aid in the interpretation of /findings and established  test  metric  standards.  Finally, neuropathic pain is evidenced by positive neural symptoms such as tingling, burning, and dysesthesia, and/or negative neural symptoms, such as loss of sensation. These symptoms can be evaluated using sensory testing and/or the painDETECT questionnaire. 66

Based on a patient's self-reported history, a clinician may choose to screen for ongoing psychological factors contributing to pain. Psychological factors can be assessed clinically using 1 or more instruments available to screen for depression, 67,68 anxiety, 68,69 pain catastrophizing, 70 fear of movement or reinjury, 71,72 or pain self-ef/ficacy. 73 The use of abbreviated screening tools, such as a 2-item depression screening test, require little time and have greater accuracy than a physical therapist's personal assessment. 74 There are also screening tools available to help determine the appropriate level of care for patients with  psychosocial  concerns,  such  as pursuing an intervention implemented solely by physical therapists trained in

the biopsychosocial approach versus a multidisciplinary team with a clinical psychologist. 75-77

Physical therapists have unique skills to evaluate patient-speci/fic movement dysfunction. In people with pain, movement  system  changes  are  unique  to each individual, can be task dependent, and can range from subtle to severe. 12,78 Several considerations for evaluation of movement system function in relation to pain are outlined in Figure 4. For some patients, pain can cause motor inhibition (eg, weakness 79 ), whereas others have motor facilitation (eg, increased muscle tension 80 ). It is important to determine if the motor dysfunction is a direct result of pain, or a more long-term adaptation that is volitional or re/flexive. If it is a direct result of pain, reducing the pain will likely restore the movement pattern. 79 The phase of healing is also relevant for determining how a motor adaptation should be addressed in physical therapy. For someone with a recent hip fracture, assistive devices are initially used to help reduce the load on the injured limb, but, with time, patients may need help restoring nonprotective motor adaptations to avoid prolonged loading imbalances. 81

The value of identifying pain mechanisms for each individual, rather than

assuming any particular pain mechanism(s) to be associated with certain diagnoses,  is  improved  personalized treatment. Pain processing physiology, psychological  states,  and  movement function can vary widely within a single diagnosis. 62 For example, people with /fibromyalgia demonstrate  dysfunctional central  inhibition,  based  on  lowered inhibitory CPM, compared to healthy controls. Yet, some individuals with /fibromyalgia have normal CPM responses, while some healthy controls exhibit reduced CPM inhibition (Fig. 5A). 12 Further, not all individuals with pain exhibit elevated psychosocial factors. For example, in an ongoing clinical trial, 82 only 26% of women with /fibromyalgia had high pain catastrophizing and 51% had high fear of movement (Fig. 5B). Although these percentages are higher than those of healthy controls (1.1% with high pain catastrophizing), many women with /fibromyalgia did not report  these   psychological   constructs. Finally, movement patterns in individuals with low back pain can vary substantially, with either increased or decreased  extensor  muscle  activation. 53 Together these research /findings illustrate that heterogeneity in pain mechanisms can be substantial between individuals within the same pain diagnosis (eg, high variability in central pain processing measures or psychological

In a comparison of people with fibromyalgia and healthy controls, although there was an overall decrease, on average there were clearly people with fibromyalgia who presented with normal CPM and healthy  controls  who  presented  with  reduced CPM. (B) Analysis of data from an ongoing  fibromyalgia  activity  study  with transcutaneous  electrical  stimulation  (n  = 172) revealed the variability in psychological measures in people with fibromyalgia 82 ; 26% had high scores on the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (> 30/52), and 51% had high scores on the Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia (> 37/68).

assessments), that patients may present with only certain components of a pain mechanism (eg, high fear of movement but no pain catastrophizing or depression), and that patients can present with multiple  pain  mechanisms  (eg,  central sensitization and heightened psychosocial  factors).  Although  physical therapists routinely assess a variety of outcomes for sensory, motor, function, and emotional/affective components of pain, we suggest adding assessments from a mechanistic standpoint as the next step in advancing optimal pain care.

## Mechanisms Underlying Physical Therapist Interventions

Once  pain  mechanisms  are  identi/fied, the second phase of the mechanism-based  approach  is  to  provide treatment(s)  targeting  these  mechanisms. Outlined below are brief summaries of how several potential therapies (exercise, manual therapy, TENS, and patient education) can alter individual pain mechanisms, but is not an exhaustive list. Although the underlying mechanisms of several treatments have been well documented, our mechanistic understanding of many other treatment options remains incomplete. These 4 treatments were chosen for their common  use  and  documented  effectiveness for pain treatment. Each type of intervention can involve  various forms, which we do not  speci/fically address. For  example, studies on  exercise can include aerobic and/or strengthening. Manual therapy can include soft-tissue massage,  stretching,  or  joint  mobilization. Pain education and cognitivebehavioral therapy-informed techniques  used  by  physical  therapists encompass  a  wide  range  of  topics, including education, coping strategies, problem  solving,  pacing,  relaxation and imagery. 47,63,83-85 TENS can be used with a variety of settings, such as low or high frequency. Figure 6A summarizes potential mechanisms, also further described below, with more extensive reviews available elsewhere. 12

Although  a  pain  mechanism-based approach may be novel for physical therapy, pharmacology has long used treatments  targeting  a  speci/fic  pain mechanism  to  maximize  therapeutic bene/fit (Fig. 6B). For example, a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial in patients with peripheral neuropathic pain found treatment response  differed  based  on  nociceptor phenotype. Oxcarbazepine, a sodium channel blocker that reduces nociceptor activity, had a larger effect in the 'irritable  nociceptor'  group  than  the 'nonirritable nociceptor' group (number needed to treat = 4 vs 13). 86 Thus, the knowledge of nociceptor phenotype in this patient population helps inform  which  pharmacological  treat-

ment may be most effective. Although we provide only a partial list of all possible interventions for pain, our intention is to demonstrate how the mechanism-based approach may be applied when attempting to match treatments to underlying pain mechanisms.

## Nociceptive Mechanisms

Exercise therapy. Basic science evidence shows that exercise reduces nociceptor activity by decreasing ion channel  expression,  increasing  expression of endogenous  analgesic  sub stances in  exercising  muscle  (neurotrophins), and altering local immune cell function (increased anti-in/flammatory cytokines). 20-27 Further, exercise restores normal movement of joint and tissue, 87 which could hypothetically  remove  a  mechanical irritant to a nociceptor. Thus, exercise decreases  nociceptor  excitability,  increases  peripheral  inhibition,  and  promotes healing of injured tissues, which makes  exercise  particularly  useful  to those with nociceptive pain.

Manual therapy. Basic science evidence shows that joint manipulation activates analgesic systems peripherally (cannabinoid,  adenosine)  in  several animal  models  of  pain. 88 In  animal models, stretching increases expression and release of mediators that reduce in/flammation,  such  as  resolvins  to promote healing and reduce pain. 89,90 Additionally, massage therapy reduces expression of in/flammatory genes and cytokines  that  activate  nociceptors, and increases the tissue repair genes. 91 Further,  manual  therapy  techniques restore normal  movement  of  joint and connective tissue, 92 which could hypothetically  remove  a  mechanical irritant to a nociceptor. Thus, manual therapy  can  target  nociceptive  pain because it increases peripheral in hibition, promotes healing of injured/in/flamed tissues, and may reduce  mechanical  activation  of  a nociceptor.

TENS. Application of TENS can target distinct nociceptive pain mechanisms. 7-11 TENS  can  alter  sympathetic  activity to reduce pain through activation of local 𝛂 2A-noradrenergic  receptors, 7,8 activate peripheral inhibitory 𝛍 -opioid

receptors, 9 and reduce the excitatory neurotransmitter,  substance  P,  which normally increases in injured animals. 10,11 Thus, TENS would be useful for those with enhanced sympathetic activity and nociceptor sensitization.

## Central Mechanisms

Education. Educating  patients  about pain mechanisms and challenging maladaptive  pain  cognitions/behaviors can alter central pain processing. 63,83 In people with chronic pain, an increased understanding of pain using the 'explain pain' 93 paradigm  corresponds  to  an increase in pain threshold 83 and increases in CPM  (central inhibition). 63 Thus education may be useful for those with maladaptive  cognitions  and  behaviors associated with altered CNS processing.

Exercise therapy. The most studied, and well-accepted, central mechanism to produce analgesia by exercise involves activation of descending inhibitory systems with increases in  endogenous  opioids  and  altered serotonin function. 28-31 Studies in animals and people have shown that regular exercise can prevent or reduce  the  risk  of  developing

chronic pain. 28,94-97 Mechanistically, regular exercise reduces central excitability and expression of excitatory neurotransmitters in spinal cord, brain stem, and cortical nociceptive sites. 28 In animal models of pain, regular aerobic exercise increases release of endogenous opioids in the midbrain and brain stem, speci/fically the  periaqueductal  gray and rostral ventromedial medulla. 28,29,31 In  the  serotonergic  system  there  is decreased expression of the serotonin transporter and increased release of the neurotransmitter serotonin in the rostral ventromedial  medulla  that  leads  to enhanced analgesia. 28-30,98 Additionally, regular exercise reduces  glial cell activation, increases anti-in/flammatory cytokines, and decreases in/flammatory cytokines  in  the  spinal  cord. 24,94 In parallel, QST in healthy adults shows greater levels of exercise are associated with  lower  central  excitability  (ie, temporal  summation),  greater  pain thresholds, and greater inhibition (CPM). 28,96,97 Thus, regular exercise can modulate  pain  sensitivity  by  altering central nociceptive processing and increasing  central  inhibition  in  both animals and people, making it an ideal choice for those with nociplastic pain.

Manual  therapy. There  is  growing evidence that massage and joint manipulation  modulate  central  pain mechanisms. 87,99-106 Massage  activates descending inhibitory pathways, using oxytocin to produce  analgesia, 99,100 whereas joint mobilization uses serotonin, noradrenaline, adenosine, and cannabinoid receptors in the spinal cord to produce analgesia. 87,101,102 Joint mobilizations  can  also  reduce  glial cell activation in the spinal cord. 103 In people,  manipulation  reduces  central excitability  as  measured  by  reduced temporal summation, in the region of primary  hyperalgesia, 107 and  reduced secondary hyperalgesia in those with chronic pain. 106,108 Thus, manual therapy techniques  activate  central  inhibitory mechanisms and reduce central excitability to produce analgesia in both people and animal models of pain.

TENS. TENS works primarily through central mechanisms by increasing central inhibition and reducing central excitability. 12-19 Studies in animal models of pain show that high and low-frequency TENS analgesia activates multiple  central  pathways,  including the  spinal  cord,  rostral  ventromedial

medulla, periaqueductal gray, and multiple cortical sites. 13,14,19 The central inhibitory  neurotransmitters  involved in the analgesia include 𝛍 -opioid and serotonin  receptors  (low  frequency) and delta-opioid receptors (high frequency), 14,15 which have been con/firmed in people  with  chronic pain. 16,17 TENS also produces analgesia through activation of GABA A receptors and muscarinic receptors (M1, M3) in the spinal cord. 18,109 In parallel, TENS also reduces central sensitization measured directly in nociceptive dorsal  horn  neurons, 110 and  reduces release  and  expression  of  excitatory neurotransmitters (glutamate and substance P), glial cell activation, and in/flammatory cytokines and mediators in the dorsal horn. 10,11,111 In individuals with /fibromyalgia, high-frequency TENS restores central inhibition (CPM), and increases pressure pain thresholds at  the  site  and  outside  the  site  of stimulation,  supporting  a  modulation of  central  nociceptive  processing  in humans. 112 Thus, TENS activates central inhibitory pathways and reduces central sensitization simultaneously to reduce pain and hyperalgesia.

## Neuropathic Mechanisms

Exercise therapy. Regular aerobic exercise increases anti-in/flammatory cytokines (eg, interleukin 4) and the expression of M2 macrophages, which secrete anti-in/flammatory cytokines at the site of injury. 24,32 Regular aerobic exercise can also decrease expression of M1 macrophages and in/flammatory cytokine  production  at  the  site  of injury. 24,32 These effects on cytokines and macrophages promote nerve healing and analgesia in animal models of  neuropathic  pain. 24,32 In  people with diabetic neuropathy, a decrease in  pain  is  associated  with  increased growth of epidermal nerve /fibers after a  regular  exercise  program. 113 Thus, exercise can be considered a diseasemodifying  treatment  in  neuropathic pain conditions by promoting healing of injured tissues.

Manual  therapy. In  animal  models of neuropathic pain, mobilization promotes healing by increasing myelin sheath thickness in peripherally injured nerves. 103 Theoretically, manual therapy

/H18549

techniques, like those used in neural mobilization,  could  ameliorate  nerve compression as cadaver studies show dispersal of intraneural /fluid with neural mobilization. 114,115 Thus, manual therapy has the potential to improve healing and reduce nerve compression in  neuropathic  pain;  however,  these effects need to be con/firmed in future studies.

## Psychosocial Mechanisms

Education. Education  and  cognitivebehavioral therapy-informed techniques are aimed at changing beliefs and behaviors that contribute to distress, fear, catastrophizing, and anxiety.  For  example,  patients  with acute low back pain educated using a  fear-avoidance  model  and  graded exercise  (see  home  study  course 116 ) had lower fear-avoidance beliefs. 47 Pain education reduces pain catastrophizing and negative pain cognitions, but may not directly affect pain scores. 117-119

Exercise therapy. Exercise is a wellaccepted means to improve a number of negative psychological factors that  are  related  to  pain,  including catastrophizing, depression, and cognitive dysfunction. 33,34 Exercise also improves learning, memory, and neurogenesis. 120,121 In mice, voluntary exercise reduces depressive behaviors with concomitant increases in  brain-derived  neurotrophic  factor and  opioid  receptor  expression  in the  hippocampus. 122,123 Although  the neurobiological mechanisms in humans are less clear, Cochrane reviews indicate  exercise  reduces  depressive symptoms 124 and  improves  cognitive function. 125 Pain  catastrophizing  can also  decline  with  exercise, 126 and  is negatively correlated with the magnitude of exercise-induced analgesia. 127 Thus, exercise reduces negative psychological factors associated pain, and can improve cognitive and social factors.

Manual therapy. There are a number of  studies  suggesting  that  massage reduces psychological distress. Massage decreases cortisol in the blood in people with a wide range of pain conditions, including juvenile rheumatoid arthritis,  burn  injury,  migraines,  and autoimmune  disorders. 128,129 Massage

also  reduces  stress  and  anxiety  in people without pain. 130-132 However, the effects of manual therapy, particularly mobilizations,  on  other  pain-related psychological  constructs  is  not  well characterized.

## Movement System

Education. Educational techniques for altering the movement system are often given in combination with an exercise program, making it dif/ficult to assess the effect of education alone. For example, there  was  a  greater  improvement  in performance of a straight leg raise and forward bend after pain education with exercise  compared  with  an  anatomy education with exercise, 117 suggesting that pain education  with  exercise has  the  potential  enhance  changes in movement  patterns.  Additionally, relaxation techniques, biofeedback and cognitive-behavioral  therapy-informed techniques can reduce motor facilitation or muscle spasm. 133 Thus, neuroscience education may be particularly useful to help improve general function, whereas biofeedback and relaxation techniques could be more useful for those with enhanced motor facilitation.

Exercise therapy. The type of exercise  prescribed  will  depend  on the movement  system  dysfunction found in the assessment (Fig. 4). For example, strengthening may be optimal if weakness and motor inhibition are present, 36 but may be less effective if muscle spasm or motor facilitation is present. 134 Stretching may be effective for  tight  or  limited  joint  range  of motion, thereby normalizing movement and subsequently reducing pain. 135,136 Graded  exercise  or  graded  exposure may be useful for patients with volitional, nonprotective movement system adaptations that interfere with activity participation. 37,38 Further, as mentioned above, neuromuscular reeducation can help  normalize  movement  patterns, resulting in reduced pain with activity. 87 A systematic review showed that  strengthening  and  strengthening combined with aerobic exercise demonstrated moderate or large effect sizes on pain and function in women with  /fibromyalgia, whereas  aerobic alone  resulted  in  no  effect  or  small effect sizes. 35 Although more research

is needed to determine adequate dose, timing, and combinations of exercise types, exercise can alter the movement system in order to improve function and disability.

Manual therapy. Manual therapy can be used to relieve pain, increase joint range of motion, and improve function for a variety of musculoskeletal pain conditions. 91,108,137 Spinal manual therapy  techniques  ranging  in  force from manipulation with high velocity thrust to a nonthrust  mobilization technique decrease motor neuron excitability. 138,139 On  the  other  hand, manipulation increases activity of the  oblique  abdominal  muscles  in those  with  low  back  pain. 140 Thus, manipulation  may  be  useful  to  help normalize motor function; however it is unclear at present which techniques work best for increasing versus decreasing motor activity.

TENS. The  use  of  a  pain-relieving modality, such as TENS, may normalize movement if pain is re/flexively causing abnormal motor activation or if there is  increased  pain  with  activity  since it  works  best  to  reduce  movementevoked  pain. 112 Although  TENS  may not directly target the movement system,  this,  and  any  pain  relieving technique, may be used to target paininduced nonvolitional abnormal motor patterns, or increase patient tolerance for exercise.

## Implementation of the Mechanism-Based Approach

Although  each  pain  mechanism  can be addressed individually by the treatments discussed above, the ef/ficiency of an intervention can be maximized when considering multiple pain mechanisms might be addressed simultaneously. Physical therapists routinely prescribe exercise to address alterations in the movement system, and the choice of exercise type is informed by concurrent pain mechanisms when using a mechanism-based approach. For example, for patients with a nociceptive-driven pain condition,  a  region-speci/fic   exercise program  may  be  most  effective.  In contrast, patients with nociplastic pain

may bene/fit more from a generalized strengthening or an aerobic conditioning program aimed at altering central inhibition and excitation. In addition, as people with chronic pain often have movement-evoked pain, the addition of an adjunct treatment, such as TENS, 112 may be useful to improve exercise tolerance. For patients with fear of movement,  graded-exposure  to  exercise, where exercises are progressed based on the patient's level of fear, may work to increase function while also decreasing pain-related fear. 37,38,47 Further, the intensity of exercise needed to reduce pain  and  improve  function  is  likely much less than intensities typically recommended for health bene/fits of physical activity. 77 In fact, as shown by a wide range of clinical trials (see table of systematic reviews on exercise-induced analgesia), 12 just 2 or 3 times per week for 20 to 30 minutes is adequate to produce pain relief and improve function in a variety of painful conditions.

Although  nearly  all  patients  receive some education about their pain condition, the type of education may be distinctly different depending on the evaluation. Individualized patient education based on pain-mechanisms could range from focusing on modi/fication of maladaptive beliefs for those with high pain catastrophizing to education of underlying central mechanisms for those with nociplastic pain. In patients with chronic low back pain, exercise combined with targeted pain education, was more effective at reducing pain and disability compared to exercise with a biomechanical pain education approach. 141,142 Sociocultural factors may be addressed by encouraging family members and physicians to emphasize active patient participation  in  exercise  prescription, which also improves intervention adherence. 143,144

Based  on  known  underlying  mechanisms, physical therapist interventions may produce additive or even synergistic interactions with pharmaceutical agents, or enhance effectiveness of multiple  physical  therapist  interventions. For example, repeated application of a single frequency of TENS produces analgesic  tolerance. 145,146 However, combining low- and high-frequency TENS

(eg,  simple  modulated  pulse  mode) prevents tolerance. 147 Exercise, which uses  serotonergic  mechanisms,  could produce longer-lasting effects in those taking reuptake inhibitors. Alternatively, negative interactions between treatments may also occur. For example, in mice and people with opioid tolerance, low-frequency TENS does not produce analgesia. 16,146 Thus, understanding the mechanisms will help to make better individualized treatment choices based the patient's current treatment program.

Although we have a fairly strong understanding of underlying mechanisms for physical therapist interventions, and understand conceptually how individual treatments might affect different types of pain mechanisms, there are limited studies using these nonpharmacological treatments in a mechanism-based manner. Most clinical studies compare 2 treatments, such as 2 different exercise programs, in a recruited population without considering the underlying mechanisms, with mixed results. 86,92 We suggest that future studies should be designed to identify treatments based on underlying mechanisms, and test if targeted treatments produce improved outcomes. Future studies should also investigate  the  multimodal  effects  of combining multiple physical therapist interventions,  as  well  as  combining physical  therapy  and  pharmaceutical treatments targeting underlying mechanisms to provide clinicians with the most effective treatment programs for pain.

## Conclusion

Although there is much we have yet to learn about underlying pain mechanisms and optimal interventions, signi/ficant advances have occurred in the science of pain that are clinically relevant to physical therapists. Pain is now recognized as more than a peripherally driven symptom; it is a multidimensional construct that can become a disease itself when chronic. 1 Whether patients present to therapy for acute or persistent pain conditions, the goals of therapy are often aimed at reducing pain and restoring function. The mechanism-based  approach  provides an additional conceptual framework for physical therapists to make  educated

treatment  decisions  that  incorporate known basic science and clinical evidence with individualized assessments to optimize patient care and clinical effectiveness.  Although  the  evidence elucidating these pain mechanisms will continue to evolve, the approach outlined here provides a conceptual framework to apply new knowledge as advances are made.
