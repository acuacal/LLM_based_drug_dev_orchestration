Background: Risks  associated  with  polypharmacy  and  drug-drug  interactions  represent a challenge in drug treatment, especially in older adults. The aim of the present study was to assess  the  use  of  prescription  and  non-prescription  drugs  and  the  frequency  of  potential drug-drug interactions in home-dwelling older individuals.

Methods: A cross-sectional study design was applied. Data were collected during preventive  home  visits  among  individuals  aged  ≥75  in  three  separate  communities  of  Western Norway. A questionnaire, which was filled out by the individual, their next-of-kin, and the nurse performing the home visit was used for the collection of demographic and clinical data (age, sex, medication use, diagnoses, need of assistance with drug administration). Potential drug-drug interactions were identified electronically by IBM Micromedex Drug Interaction Checking. Point prevalence of potential drug-drug interactions and polypharmacy (≥5 drugs) were calculated. Binary logistic regression analyses were performed to assess factors potentially associated with polypharmacy or potential drug-drug interactions.

Results: Among the 233 individuals (mean age 78±3 years, 46% male) included in the study, 43% used ≥5 drugs, 3.4% ≥10 drugs, while 4.3% used no drugs. In 54% of the 197 individuals using two or more drugs, at least one potential drug-drug interaction was detected. Low-dose aspirin and simvastatin were most frequently involved in potential drug-drug interactions. In total, 25% of the individuals reported current use of drugs sold over the counter of which more than  95%  were  analgesic  drugs.  Potential  drug-drug  interactions  involving  ibuprofen  were identified in nine of 11 (82%) individuals using over-the-counter ibuprofen.

Conclusion: The study revealed a high prevalence of polypharmacy and potential drug-drug interactions with both prescription and non-prescription drugs in older home-dwelling individuals. Close monitoring of the patients at risk of drug-drug interactions, and increased awareness of the potential of over-the-counter drugs to cause drug-drug interactions, is needed.

## Introduction

Polypharmacy  in  older  people  is  frequent,  and  recent  data  from  the  Norwegian Prescription  Database  has  shown  that  23%  of  the  prescription  drug  users  65  years and older were prescribed 10 or more drugs in 2017. 1 Polypharmacy in older people is a double-edged sword. Many drugs are crucial in the treatment of diseases, and relief of symptoms, in multimorbid older individuals. Concomitantly, polypharmacy is associated  with  increased  risk  of  drug-drug  interactions  and  adverse  events  leading  to functional decline, hospital admission, and even death. 2-4 Adverse events related to drug use are estimated to cause around 10% of hospital admissions in older people. 2

Drug-drug  interactions  (DDIs)  occur  when  the  effect of a drug is affected by a concomitantly administered second drug. The result of drug-drug  interactions can be either decreased effect of the affected drug or  enhanced  effect,  and  consequently  increased  risk  of side-effects. The  frequency  of  DDIs  increases  with increasing number of drugs. 5 The reported frequencies of DDIs in observational studies vary between 15% and 70% depending on the characteristics of the study participants (age,  morbidity),  the  setting,  and  assessment  of  potential DDIs. 5-10

Through the last decades, increasing attention has been drawn towards improving drug prescription in older individuals.  This  has  resulted  in  increased  use  of  clinical decision  support  systems  for  prescribers,  and  increased use of structured medication reviews. In Norway, all inhabitants  are  assigned  a  regular  general  practitioner.  The regular  general  practitioner  is  responsible  for  the  coordination  of  the  patients'  drug  treatment  and  performing a  medication  review  when  needed  in  patients  with polypharmacy. 11 Both  clinical  decision  support  systems and  systematic  medication  reviews  have  been  shown  to reduce  negative  health  outcomes  from  multiple  drug  use by  reducing  potentially  serious  DDIs  and  adverse  drug reactions. 12,13

Despite the use of decision support systems and medication reviews, there is a risk of DDIs, especially for patients where multiple prescribers are involved in drug prescription. 14 This  is  likely  to  be  the  case  for  homedwellers, as they may visit other medical doctors such as different specialists, practitioners at the out-of-hours emergency primary health care or hospitals, in addition to their regular general practitioner. A Norwegian multicenter study from 2015 showed discrepancies in up to 80% of medication lists upon hospital admission, illustrating the challenge of  information  transfer. 15 Since  2012  there  have  been ongoing national efforts to develop a common system for electronic  patient  records  across  levels  of  the  health  care sector  in  Norway,  but  full  implementation  is  still  years away. 16 Therefore,  the  transfer  of  patient  information between levels will remain a challenge for several years to come. Also, self-medication with over-the-counter (OTC) drugs  is  frequent  in  older  people  with  a  prevalence  of around  40%  in  western  countries. 17,18 Previous  studies have  shown  that  common  OTC  drugs  like  aspirin  and other  non-steroid  anti-inflammatory  drugs  (NSAIDs)  are frequently involved in DDIs, and are also the drugs most commonly involved in DDIs leading to hospital

admission. 4,5,19 The use of OTC drugs, therefore, adds to the  total  risk  of  potential  DDIs.  This  is  a  challenge  in general  practice,  as  self-medication  with  OTC  drugs  are often  not  recorded  in  electronic  patient  records. 20 Also, most studies on the consequences of drug-drug interactions for hospitalization or visits to the emergency department are based  on  medical  records,  and  OTC  drugs  are  therefore often  ignored  when  evaluating  drug-drug  interactions. 19 On this basis, we aimed to assess the use of prescription and non-prescription drugs and the frequency of potential drug-drug interactions in a cross-sectional study with home interviews of older home-dwelling individuals.

## Methods

## Study Design and Data Collection

A cross-sectional study design with preventive home-visits in  home-dwelling  older  individuals  was  applied. 21 Older home-dwelling inhabitants of three different nonneighboring municipalities, one urban and two rural municipalities  of  different  sizes,  situated  in  Western  Norway, were invited to receive a preventive home visit. The three municipalities  were  selected  as  they  were  starting  up a  preventive  home  visit  program  (ie,  convenience  sampling).  The  visits  aimed  to  identify  persons  at  risk  of developing illness by addressing four focal areas; malnutrition, falls, cognitive impairment, and polypharmacy. The home  visit  program  has  previously  been  described  in detail. 21 Briefly, older home-dwellers able to communicate in  Norwegian  were  eligible  for  inclusion.  In  the  smaller community, all individuals 75 years of age and above were included  in  the  preventive  home  visit  program,  while  in the  two larger communities only home-dwellers 77 years of age were invited to receive a preventive home visit. The individuals  were  identified  by  the  Norwegian  National Registry, contacted by telephone, and asked to participate in the study. Approximately 60% of the invited individuals agreed  to  participate. 21 The  preventive  home  visits  were performed  by  specially  trained  nurses.  The  nurses  collected  data  using  a  questionnaire,  which  consisted  of a  substantial  number  of  questions  and  validated  tests  on cognitive  function,  balance/falls,  nutrition,  and  polypharmacy, in addition to questions on demographics, lifestyle, and medical diagnoses. 21 For the focal area polypharmacy, the  individual's  age,  sex,  place  of  living  (urban/rural), prescription  and  non-prescription  drugs,  medical  diagnoses, and need for help with administration of medication were registered. Data on the use of prescription and non-

prescription  medication  was  collected  during  the  home visit  by  a  combination of sources; interview with participant and next-of-kin, visual inspection of medication after asking the participants to show the medication they were using, and written information in form of a medication list issued  by  the  individuals'  general  practitioner  (available for  23%  of  the  participants)  or  home  care  nursing  service (11%).

## Data Analysis

Two  of  the  authors  screened  for  drug-drug  interactions. IBM Micromedex ® Drug Interaction Checking (electronic version) was selected as knowledge base to identify potential  drug-drug  interactions,  based  on  previous  reports  on accuracy and comprehensiveness. 22-24 In the presentation of  the  results,  the  term  potential  drug-drug  interaction (pDDI) is used, as many drug-drug interactions are avoidable  and  manageable  with  dose  adjustments  and/or  close clinical follow-up and we do not have data on the consequence of the pDDI in the individual patient. PDDIs were classified  in  accordance  with  the  classification  system  of Micromedex as either; contraindicated, major (interaction may be life-threatening or require medical intervention to minimize  or  prevent  adverse  effects),  or  moderate  (the interaction may result in exacerbation of the patient's condition and/or require an alteration on therapy). The primary and secondary endpoints were point-prevalences of pDDIs and polypharmacy, respectively. Polypharmacy was defined as  the  use  of  five  or  more  drugs. 25 All  participants  were included  in  the  analysis  of  point  prevalence  of  polypharmacy, while only individuals using 2 or more drugs were included in the calculations of point-prevalence of pDDIs.

The  study  sample  was  described  in  terms  of  demographics (age, sex, place of living (urban/rural), diagnoses, need for help with medicine administration), polypharmacy and drug-drug interactions using mean and standard deviation  for  continuous  variables  and  frequencies  and  percentages  for  categorical  variables.  Binary  logistic  regression analyses were used to assess factors potentially associated with  polypharmacy,  and drug-drug interactions.  Age, sex, place  of  living  (urban/rural),  'need  help  with  medicines' (yes/no) and clinical diagnose were investigated as potential covariates in the analysis of polypharmacy. In the analysis of  pDDIs,  the  total  number  of  medications  was  also included as a potential covariate. The category 'need help with  medicines'  included  individuals  that  received  help with  administration  of  medicines  from  their  next-of-kins or  home  care  nurses.  Diagnose  categories  were  collapsed

to reduce the number of independent variables and increase the  frequency  of  positive  outcomes  in  each  category. Diagnose categories with less than 10% positive outcomes (ie, less than persons with the disease) were not included in the  regression  models.  The  included  diagnose  categories were as follows: diabetes, cardiovascular disease (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, heart failure, coronary heart disease), lung  disease  (chronic  obstructive  pulmonary  disease  and asthma),  cancer,  musculoskeletal  disorders  (osteoporosis, arthritis).  Preliminary  analyses  were  performed  to  ensure that  the  variables  were  not  subjected  to  multicollinearity. The  ratio  of  cases  to  variables  in  the  logistic  regression analysis  was  above  20.  As  there  were  no  variables  with a positive response rate of less than 10%, the sample size was considered sufficient for this analysis. A p-value <0.05 was  considered  a  statistically  significant  difference.  SPSS version 27 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA) was used for statistical analyses.

## Results

In total, data from 233 home-dwellers were included, 109 from  the  urban  community  and  124  from  the  rural  communities. The mean age of the participants was 78±3 years and  46%  were  male.  Hypertension  and  hyperlipidemia were  the  two  most  common  diagnoses,  affecting  52% and 43% of the individuals, respectively (Table 1).

## Polypharmacy

The median number of drugs was 4 (range 0-15) and polypharmacy  was  registered  for  102  individuals  (43%).  Eight individuals (3.4%) used 10 or more drugs while 10 (4.3%) individuals did not use any drugs (Table 2). Diabetes diagnose (P=0.021), cardiovascular disease (P<0.001), and 'need help  with  medicines'  (P=0.022)  were  positively  associated with polypharmacy (Table 3). Age, sex, place of living, and the  diagnoses  of  cancer,  lung  disease,  and  musculoskeletal disease were not significantly associated with polypharmacy.

## Potential Drug-Drug Interactions

In total, 197 individuals used two or more drugs. Among these  individuals,  302  pDDIs  were  identified,  affecting 107  (54%)  of  the  individuals.  A  total  number  of  132 pDDIs were classified as major pDDIs and these affected 80 (41%) of the individuals (Table 2). Two of the patients, using  10  and  14  different  drugs,  respectively,  were  each exposed  to  six  major  pDDIs.  The  total  number  of  drugs was  associated  with  both  being  exposed  to  a  least  one pDDI  and  at  least  one  major  pDDI  (P<0.001,  Table  3).

Also,  cardiovascular  disease  was  positively  associated with being exposed to a pDDI (P=0.023). Age, sex, place of living, need of help with medicines, and the diagnoses of  diabetes,  lung  disease,  musculoskeletal  disease,  and cancer were not significantly associated with pDDIs.

One individual used a contraindicated combination (isosorbide mononitrate and sildenafil). Among the 132 identified major pDDIs, the drugs most frequently involved were low-dose  aspirin  (47  times)  and  simvastatin  (32  times) (Table 4). Simvastatin in combination with a calcium channel blocker, amlodipine (17 individuals), verapamil (3 individuals), and diltiazem (1 individual) was the most common pDDI. For aspirin, the most common pDDI was combination with a diuretic (hydrochlorothiazide or loop-diuretic, n=16). Also,  aspirin  in  combination  with  other  drugs  affecting platelet  function  or  coagulation;  NSAID  (6  individuals), warfarin (1 individual), and clopidogrel (1 individual) was frequently observed. Buprenorphine was the drug most frequently involved in pDDIs considering the number of users, with eight pDDIs in only four individuals (Table 4).

## Over-the-Counter Medications

In total, 61 (26%) of the individuals reported current use of OTC medication. In 95% of the observations, the OTC drug  was  a  pain  reliever,  mainly  paracetamol  which  was used  by  55  (90%)  of  the  OTC  users.  Nine  of  the  11 individuals  (82%)  using  ibuprofen  were  exposed  to  at least one potential drug-drug interaction involving ibuprofen.  In  seven  of  the  nine  individuals  (56%)  with  a  pDDI involving  ibuprofen,  the  interaction  was  classified  as major.  The  major  pDDIs  involving  ibuprofen  were  interactions with aspirin or amitriptyline causing an increased risk of bleeding (n=3) and interactions with thiazide diuretics resulting in loss of diuretic effect (n=2).

## Discussion

The results of this study demonstrate that almost half of the older  home-dwelling  individuals  use  five  or  more  drugs. Few  other  studies  have  described  the  prevalence  of  polypharmacy  in  a  sample  of  home-dwellers  not  restricted  to diagnosis or morbidity. However, the results are comparable to  three  recently  published  studies. 6,7,26 Santos  et  al 6 and Novaes et al 7 found prevalences of polypharmacy from 26% to 45% in home-dwelling older individuals in Brazil, while Wauters et al 26 observed a prevalence of approximately 60% in  slightly  older  individuals  (mean  age  84)  in  Belgium. There are several challenges associated with polypharmacy, the  main  one  being  drug-drug  interactions  and  risk  of adverse  events. 2-5 In  agreement  with  previous  findings, a  strong  association  between  the  number  of  drugs  and

drug-drug  interaction  was  also  observed  in  the  present study. 5 Recently, polypharmacy has also been shown to be associated with under-prescribing, and it is speculated that this might be a result of fear of causing harm to the patient through drug-drug interactions and adverse events. 27

Overall,  in  the  present  study  pDDIs  were  detected  in 54%  of  home-dwelling  older  individuals  using  two  or more  drugs.  This  was  higher  than  previous  findings  in similar age groups and settings. 6,7 Cardiovascular disease was  the  most  common  diagnosis  in  this  population  and having a cardiovascular diagnose was positively associated with  both  polypharmacy  and  pDDIs.  This  was  in  agreement with  the  finding  that  drugs  used  to  treat  cardiovascular  disease  were  most  frequently  involved  in  major pDDIs,  with  simvastatin  and  aspirin  being  the  two  most

Hermann et al

frequent.  For  simvastatin,  the  most  commonly  observed combination was with the calcium channel blocker amlodipine.  Concomitant  use  of  these  two  drugs  may  lead  to increased systemic exposure of simvastatin due to inhibition of CYP3A4  by  amlodipine  and  consequently increased  risk  of  myopathy  and  rhabdomyolysis. 28 The risk  of  rhabdomyolysis  is  dose-related,  and  doses  of 20  mg  or  lower  of  simvastatin  are  recommended  when used concomitantly with amlodipine. 29,30 The risk of rhabdomyolysis is elevated in older individuals, and there have been  several  case  reports  on  serious  rhabdomyolysis  in older individuals where simvastatin has been used in combination  with  a  CYP3A4  inhibitor. 31-33 In  the  present study,  more  than  95% of  statin  users  were  using  simvastatin.  The  high  use  of  simvastatin  compared  with  other statins  relates  to  a  decision  made  by  the  Norwegian Medicines Agency in 2005 that simvastatin should be the preferred  statin  to  reduce  costs  for  the  society. 34 After 2014, the prescription of statins has not been subjected to restrictions, but many patients have nevertheless continued using  simvastatin.  The  large  number  of  major  pDDIs involving  simvastatin  observed  in  this  study  is  therefore probably  not  only  a  result  of  the  drug-drug  interaction potential  of  simvastatin  compared  with  other  statins  but also the large use of this drug in the population.

For  aspirin,  a  common  major  pDDI  was  combination with  drugs  causing  an  additive  risk  of  bleeding.  In  the present study, both prescribed and OTC NSAIDs are registered, but even so, the reported frequency of the combination  of  aspirin  and  an  NSAID  is  lower  than  previously reported  data  from  the  Swedish  prescription  registry  in people  ≥75  years. 5 However,  in  total,  58%  of  the  81 individuals in the present study using antithrombotic treatment  (warfarin,  aspirin,  clopidogrel,  or  dabigatran)  were exposed  to  a  major  pDDI.  This  is  similar  to  the  recent finding  by  Schneider  et  al,  where  potentially  severe  or contraindicated interactions were detected in 58% of outpatients  ≥60  years  on  antithrombotic  therapy. 35 The high frequencies of major pDDIs in patients on antithrombotic therapy  calls  for  a  continuous  close  monitoring  of  these patients.

A striking observation in this study was the high prevalence of major pDDIs in patients using buprenorphine. In two of the four individuals using buprenorphine, eight major  pDDIs  involving  buprenorphine  were  detected. However,  these  were  multimorbid  patients  using  14  and 8  prescription  drugs,  respectively.  Although  the  risk  of DDIs is known to increase with an increasing number of

drugs, the high number of major pDDIs per user involving buprenorphine warrants a close follow-up of patients using this drug. 5

A common feature of many of the pDDIs observed in this  study  is  that  a  potentially  harmful  clinical  outcome may  theoretically  be  limited  by  dose  adjustments  of  the affected drug and/or increased monitoring of the patients. No  information  on  the  prescribers  was  collected  in  this study,  and  consequently,  information  on  precautions  like dose  adjustments  or  close  follow-up  of  the  patients  was not  available.  However,  the  relatively  high  prevalence  of major  pDDIs  might  indicate  that  medication  reviews should  be  performed  more  frequently.  Currently,  in Norway,  a  legal  regulation  calls  for  yearly  medication reviews in patients where the regular general practitioner finds it necessary, but data on how often this is performed in  practice  is  not  available.  Also,  it  is  known  from  previous  research  that  medication  records  are  incomplete  or contain  errors  in  more  than  half  of  the  cases  in  both primary  and  secondary  health  care,  which  complicates the work with identifying pDDIs. 36,37

Nine of the 11 individuals using OTC ibuprofen, used it  in  combination  with  a  prescription  drug  resulting  in a  pDDIs  causing  increased  risk  of  bleeding  (aspirin, tricyclic  antidepressants)  or  affecting  renal  function (diuretics).  Although  the  risk  of  GI  bleeding  has  not been  studied  specifically  for  OTC  NSAIDs,  there  is a  large  body  of  evidence  showing  that  GI  bleedings associated  with  NSAID  use  increases  with  increasing age  and  use  of  multiple  NSAIDs,  including  low  dose aspirin. 38 The  fact  that  82%  of  the  older  individuals that used ibuprofen also used an interacting prescription drug,  could  be  due  to  unawareness  of  the  potentially harmful  effects  of  OTC  analgesics.  Previous  studies have shown that there is a general misperception among older  adults  that  OTC  drugs  are  too  weak  to  cause  any harm 39 and  that  the  awareness  of  pDDIs  is  higher  in younger compared with older individuals. 40 Safe use of OTC drugs is complicated by the fact that, typically, the regular  general  practitioner  is  not  informed  about  the patients'  use  of  OTC  drugs  as  these  are  generally  not registered in the electronic patient records, and therefore the  risk  of  prescribing  an  interacting  drug  increases. 20 Improved  labeling  of  OTC  analgesics,  as  suggested  by Roumie and co-workers, could potentially reduce the use of  OTC  NSAIDs  in  patients  at  risk,  or  may  lead  to patients informing the regular general practitioner about their OTC drug use. 39 Also, for patients receiving home

Dovepress

care  services  or  preventive  home  visits,  information about the patients' use of OTC drugs could be communicated  to  the  regular  general  practitioner  by  the  nurse performing the visit. 41

A limitation to the present study is the relatively limited  variance  in  age  among  the  included  participants, which might explain the lack of association between age and  polypharmacy  observed  in  this  study.  The  study  is strengthened by the fact that  information on drug  use is based on more than one source of information. In addition to medication lists from the general practitioner or home care service where this was available, information on drug use  was  also  collected  through  interviews  with  the patients  themselves  and  their  next-of-kin  and  visual inspection of actual medication in use. This increases the possibility  of  getting  more  complete  information  as  it  is known  from  previous  research  that  medication  lists  frequently contain errors. 36 Unfortunately, the general practitioners were  not  contacted  and  data  on  possible precautions (dose adjustments, closer follow-up) and clinical outcome  of  the  pDDI  are  therefore  lacking. Information on clinical outcome would have strengthened the study further. The response rate was around 60% and the main reason given for declining participation was no need for a preventive home visit. Unfortunately, characteristics  of  the  individuals  who  declined  participation were  not  collected  and,  thus,  a  possible  selection  bias cannot  be  ruled  out. 21 It  is  possible  that  the  presented data  represent  individuals  with  a  higher  disease  burden and  drug  use  than  the  general  population  in  this  region. However, health status in terms of self-rated health in the participants was comparable to other large-scale European epidemiological studies, indicating a representative sample. 42-44

## Conclusion

This  study  revealed  a  high  prevalence  of  polypharmacy and  pDDIs  with  both  prescription  and  non-prescription drugs in older home-dwelling individuals. Close monitoring of the patients at risk of pDDIs, increased awareness of the  potential  of  OTC  drugs  to  cause  DDIs,  and  good communication  between  the  general  practitioner  and patient is needed, to reduce the risk related to pDDI.
