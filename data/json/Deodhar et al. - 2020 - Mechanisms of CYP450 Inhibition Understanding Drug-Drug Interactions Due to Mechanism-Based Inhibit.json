Non-Competitive Inhibition The  non-competitive  inhibitor  does  not  generally  have  any  structural  resemblance  to  the substrate as it binds to an allosteric site. The non-competitive inhibitor will cause a conformational change in the structure of the active site such that the active site loses its affinity for the substrate. (Figure 5) Thus, there is no direct competition between the inhibitor and the substrate at the active site. This type of inhibition is often long lasting and cannot be overcome by increasing substrate concentrations. Under these conditions, a decrease in the CL int of the substrate due to a decrease in its V max is observed. Similar to competitive inhibitors, non-competitive inhibitors also have an almost immediate effect. As long as the concentration of the inhibitor is not changed, the amount of inhibition will not increase over time. This type of inhibition does not require the involvement of NADPH as a cofactor, i.e., the inhibitor is not metabolized by the enzyme, but merely sits in an allosteric site. Other non-competitive inhibition conditions may involve CYPb5 and/or CYP450 oxidoreductase as these factors have been shown to modulate CYP450 activities, at least in in vitro systems  [13,14].  Separating  the  time  of  dosing  will  not  alleviate  non-competitive  inhibition. The non-competitive inhibitor does not generally have any structural resemblance to the substrate as it binds to an allosteric site. The non-competitive inhibitor will cause a conformational change in the structure of the active site such that the active site loses its a GLYPH<14> nity for the substrate. (Figure 5) Thus, there is no direct competition between the inhibitor and the substrate at the active site. This type of inhibition is often long lasting and cannot be overcome by increasing substrate concentrations. Under these conditions, a decrease in the CL int of the substrate due to a decrease in its Vmax is observed. Similar to competitive inhibitors, non-competitive inhibitors also have an almost immediate e GLYPH<11> ect. As long as the concentration of the inhibitor is not changed, the amount of inhibition will not increase over time. This type of inhibition does not require the involvement of NADPH as a cofactor, i.e., the inhibitor is not metabolized by the enzyme, but merely sits in an allosteric site. Other non-competitive inhibition conditions may involve CYPb5 and / or CYP450 oxidoreductase as these factors have been shown to modulate CYP450 activities, at least in in vitro systems [13,14].

In another retrospective cohort study, clopidogrel use post discharge for acute coronary syndrome hospitalizations was studied [38]. Concurrent clopidogrel and PPI use was associated with an increased risk of death or rehospitalization; among patients prescribed a PPI, 60% were on omeprazole [38]. PPI plus clopidogrel use also remained significantly associated with recurrent acute coronary syndrome and revascularization procedures [38]. Another study evaluated the association between various PPIs (all PPIs combined) and individual PPI agents with clopidogrel use and increased risk of hospitalization [39].
