In this Perspective, 5 categories of pain mechanisms (nociceptive, central, neuropathic, psychosocial, and movement system) are de/fined, and principles on how to evaluate signs and symptoms for each mechanism are provided.

To individualize care, common physical therapist interventions, such as education, exercise, manual therapy, and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, can be used to target speci/fic pain mechanisms.

For example, in an ongoing clinical trial, 82 only 26% of women with /fibromyalgia had high pain catastrophizing and 51% had high fear of movement (Fig. 5B). Although these percentages are higher than those of healthy controls (1.1% with high pain catastrophizing), many women with /fibromyalgia did not report  these   psychological   constructs. Finally, movement patterns in individuals with low back pain can vary substantially, with either increased or decreased  extensor  muscle  activation. 53 Together these research /findings illustrate that heterogeneity in pain mechanisms can be substantial between individuals within the same pain diagnosis (eg, high variability in central pain processing measures or psychological"}, {"self_ref": "#/texts/94", "parent": {"$ref": "#/body"}, "children": [], "label": "page_header", "prov": [{"page_no": 5, "bbox": {"l": 570.1500244140625, "t": 572.6099853515625, "r": 577.6539916992188, "b": 210.3939971923828, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}, "charspan": [0, 97]}], "orig": "Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/ptj/article/98/5/302/4934705 by guest on 09 January 2025", "text": "Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/ptj/article/98/5/302/4934705 by guest on 09 January 2025"}, {"self_ref": "#/texts/95", "parent": {"$ref": "#/body"}, "children": [], "label": "caption", "prov": [{"page_no": 6, "bbox": {"l": 51.0, "t": 457.82501220703125, "r": 87.79199981689453, "b": 446.8450012207031, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}, "charspan": [0, 9]}], "orig": "Figure 5.", "text": "Figure 5."}, {"self_ref": "#/texts/96", "parent": {"$ref": "#/pictures/6"}, "children": [], "label": "text", "prov": [{"page_no": 6, "bbox": {"l": 173.33333333333331, "t": 662.0, "r": 178.0, "b": 652.0, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}, "charspan": [0, 1]}], "orig": "8", "text": "8"}, {"self_ref": "#/texts/97", "parent": {"$ref": "#/pictures/6"}, "children": [], "label": "text", "prov": [{"page_no": 6, "bbox": {"l": 64.33333333333333, "t": 622.3333333333333, "r": 78.33333333333333, "b": 614.3333333333333, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}, "charspan": [0, 3]}], "orig": "100", "text": "100"}, {"self_ref": "#/texts/98", "parent": {"$ref": "#/body"}, "children": [], "label": "text", "prov": [{"page_no": 6, "bbox": {"l": 51.0, "t": 446.79901123046875, "r": 211.0800018310547, "b": 247.09500122070312, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}, "charspan": [0, 823]}], "orig": "(A)  Scatterplot  showing  the  variability  in conditioned  pain  modulation  (CPM)  in people with fibromyalgia and healthy controls,  represented  as  the  percent  change in pressure thresholds before and after the CPM test.
