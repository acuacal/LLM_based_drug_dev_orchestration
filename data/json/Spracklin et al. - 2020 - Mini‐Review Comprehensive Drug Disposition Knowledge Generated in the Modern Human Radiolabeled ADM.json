Mass balance in and of itself is not a parameter that offers much toward the understanding of the drug and is mostly a value used in making other calculations (such as amount of each metabolite as % of dose), nevertheless it can be disconcerting when a good mass balance is not achieved. There are practical limitations to the thoroughness that excreta can be collected and an analysis of past studies suggests that when >/uni00A085% recovery is obtained, the study can be considered successful. 9 Values marginally below that will require scrutinization of the dosing and sample collection procedures and development of a plausible explanation of why higher balance was not achieved.
