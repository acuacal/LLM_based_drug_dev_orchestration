Paradigm and rationale for decoding analyses. ( a ) At encoding, subjects (n = 24) were instructed to memorise the word-image associations using an imagery strategy and constantly update their memory with the most recent associate to each word. The experiment consisted of three different conditions. In non- competitive single- exposure condition (NC1), subjects encoded the word together with one associate; in the non- competitive dualexposure condition (NC2), subjects encoded the word with the same associate twice; and in the competitive condition (CC), subjects encoded the word together with two different associates (one scene and one object). ( b ) At retrieval, participants were instructed to remember the most recently encoded associate when prompted with a word cue. ( c ) Subordinate- category classi/fiers (animate/inanimate for objects, and indoor/outdoor for scenes) were used to obtain independent evidence for target and competitor reactivation at each sample point. Note that the superordinate (object/scene) classi/fier cannot discriminate between evidence for the target and against the competitor, and vice versa. ( d ) Hypothesised reactivation dynamics of targets and competitors relative to theta phase, based on the oscillating interference resolution model (adjusted from Norman et/uni00A0al., 2006 ). Blue circles represent the target memory, pink circles the competitor memory. Target and competitor memories consist of a number of features (small circles), some distinct and some overlapping, that can be either active (dark blue) or inactive (light blue) at any given point along the phase of the oscillation. When inhibition is high, only a few features of the target memory are active initially.

Paradigm and rationale for decoding analyses. ( a ) At encoding, subjects (n = 24) were instructed to memorise the word-image associations using an imagery strategy and constantly update their memory with the most recent associate to each word. The experiment consisted of three different conditions. In non- competitive single- exposure condition (NC1), subjects encoded the word together with one associate; in the non- competitive dualexposure condition (NC2), subjects encoded the word with the same associate twice; and in the competitive condition (CC), subjects encoded the word together with two different associates (one scene and one object). ( b ) At retrieval, participants were instructed to remember the most recently encoded associate when prompted with a word cue. ( c ) Subordinate- category classi/fiers (animate/inanimate for objects, and indoor/outdoor for scenes) were used to obtain independent evidence for target and competitor reactivation at each sample point. Note that the superordinate (object/scene) classi/fier cannot discriminate between evidence for the target and against the competitor, and vice versa.

The present study was not designed to track representational changes, for example, in terms of comparing target and competitor representations before and after repeated recall. Arguably, however, there is a straightforward agreement between spatial and temporal separation in this network model. Strong competitors would tend to co- activate in the high- inhibition phase and thus be co- strengthened and integrated via LTP ( Bliss and Lomo, 1973 ; Hebb, 1949 ), whereas moderately co- active competitor memories would tend to co- activate only at lower levels of inhibition, which according to the model would lead to LTD. Our data support the idea that low temporal separation is related to integration, behaviourally.

In a second step, independent component analysis (ICA) was used to detect artefacts to be removed in the data. To this end, MEG data were downsampled to 250/uni00A0Hz, and only the first 1.5/uni00A0s after cue onset were used for ICA (to reduce computational load). The unmixing matrix was then applied to the entire epoch of non- downsampled data. To remove blink and cardiac artefacts, a template was created by running an ICA on the six first participants. The components for the two artefacts were then averaged separately, and each average component was used as a template to identify matching components in each participant. For the blink template, the algorithm correlated its topography with that of each component identified in an individual participant, and subsequently removed the component with the best match.

The difference between the original power spectrum and the fractal power spectrum is the estimate of the power spectrum of the oscillatory component of the signal ( Wen and Liu, 2016 ). In this study, IRASA (as implemented in the FieldTrip toolbox) was applied to the fidelity values, in a time window from 500 to 3000 ms post- cue, padding each trial length up to the next power of 2. Apart from the reasons mentioned above, this large time window also assures that low frequencies can be properly estimated."}, {"self_ref": "#/texts/231", "parent": {"$ref": "#/body"}, "children": [], "label": "text", "prov": [{"page_no": 19, "bbox": {"l": 168.5260009765625, "t": 618.8579711914062, "r": 578.9439697265625, "b": 414.927001953125, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}, "charspan": [0, 1780]}], "orig": "To test for significance in the frequency- transformed decoding timecourses, the LDA as described above was repeated 15 times per subject, now trained on random labels in each iteration.
